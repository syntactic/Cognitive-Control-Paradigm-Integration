###### Definition
The **Congruency Effect** refers to the universal finding in [[Interference Control]] paradigms that performance is significantly better for congruent stimuli than for incongruent stimuli. It is typically measured as the difference in reaction time (RT) and/or error rates between these two conditions.

`Congruency Effect = RT_incongruent - RT_congruent`

A larger congruency effect indicates greater interference from the irrelevant stimulus dimension and less efficient cognitive control.

###### Manifestations in Canonical Tasks
This general effect is the core finding in several hallmark paradigms:
*   **[[Canonical Tasks/Stroop Task|Stroop Effect]]:** The cost of naming the ink color when the word meaning is incongruent (e.g., "RED" in blue ink) compared to congruent (e.g., "RED" in red ink). See [[Stroop (1935)]].
*   **[[Canonical Tasks/Flanker Task|Flanker Effect]]:** The cost of identifying a central target when it is surrounded by incongruent flankers compared to congruent flankers. See [[Eriksen & Eriksen (1974)]].
*   **[[Canonical Tasks/Simon Task|Simon Effect]]:** The cost of responding to a non-spatial feature when the stimulus's spatial location is incongruent with the response location, compared to when it is congruent. See [[Simon & Rudell (1967)]].

###### Theoretical Importance
The congruency effect is a direct measure of the failure of selective attention. It demonstrates that task-irrelevant information is often processed automatically to a stage where it can compete with and interfere with the processing of task-relevant information, particularly at the level of [[Theoretical Concepts/Response Selection Bottleneck (RSB)|response selection]]. The magnitude of the effect is often used to probe the efficiency of executive functions like inhibition and conflict monitoring.

#### Theoretical Explanation
An early and influential explanation for the congruency effect was provided by the two-pathway processing model of [[Kornblum et al. (1990)]]. They proposed that a stimulus with dimensional overlap automatically activates its corresponding response, while a parallel, controlled process identifies the required response based on task rules. The congruency effect is the behavioral cost of detecting and aborting the automatically activated response when it conflicts with the required one.
