Definition: A performance decrement (typically slower reaction times and/or increased error rates) on task-repeat trials when they occur within a block of mixed tasks (where task switching is possible), compared to performance on the same task when it is performed in a pure block (only one task performed throughout).

**Calculation:** Mixing Cost = RT_repeat_trial_in_mixed_block - RT_pure_block_trial

**Key Characteristics:**

- Observed in [[Task Switching]] paradigms.
- Suggests that maintaining multiple task sets in an active or readily accessible state incurs a general cost, even when not actually switching.
- Strongly influenced by [[Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|stimulus bivalence]]; often larger with bivalent stimuli (e.g., [[Rubin & Meiran (2005)]]).

**Theoretical Explanations:**

- Maintaining multiple active task sets in working memory.
- Increased need for task-set selection or conflict monitoring even on repeat trials.
- Reduced task-set shielding or increased between-task crosstalk in mixed blocks.

**Relevance to Design Space:**

- Highlights the general overhead associated with contexts requiring cognitive flexibility.
- Its presence differentiates performance in pure task blocks (Switch Rate = 0%) from repeat trials in mixed-task blocks (Switch Rate > 0%).
