Definition: The Psychological Refractory Period (PRP) effect is the slowing of the reaction time to the second task (RT2) when two tasks (Task 1 and Task 2) are performed in close temporal succession. The effect is most pronounced when the Stimulus Onset Asynchrony ([[Inter-task SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)]]) between the stimuli for T1 and T2 is short.

**Key Characteristics:**

- RT2 increases as SOA decreases (often with a slope approaching -1 at very short SOAs).
- RT1 is often, but not always, unaffected or only minimally affected by SOA.
- The effect is robust across various stimulus and response modalities.

**Theoretical Explanations:**

- Often attributed to a [[Bottleneck Theories|central processing bottleneck]], such as in [[Response Selection Bottleneck (RSB)|response selection]], where only one task can undergo this critical stage at a time.
- Alternative accounts involve strategic scheduling or capacity sharing (e.g., [[EPIC-SRD]]).

**Relevance to Design Space:**

- A defining phenomenon of the [[Dual-Task Performance & PRP]] paradigm region.
- The magnitude and modulation of the PRP effect (e.g., by task difficulty, preparation) are key DVs.

- [[Pashler (1994)]]
- [[Welford (1952)]] (Early work)
- [[Meyer & Kieras (1997a)]]
