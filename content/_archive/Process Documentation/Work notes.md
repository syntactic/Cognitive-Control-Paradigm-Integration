- **Resolved Meiran (1996) Conflict Coding:** Confirmed that Meiran's spatial tasks (Exp 1 & 2) contain both S-S Congruency (from competing task rules) and S-R Congruency (from stimulus location vs. key location). The paper states these two are perfectly confounded. The CSV has been updated to reflect this by coding both dimensions with the same value (e.g., Congruent/Incongruent). In contrast, Experiment 5 uses non-spatial color/shape tasks and thus only involves S-S Congruency; its S-R Congruency is correctly coded as N/A.
