## Summary

Using a PRP dual‑task setup, the paper shows that the **backward crosstalk effect (BCE)** - slower RT1 when T2 requires a no‑go—**appears when the secondary stimulus unambiguously signals a specific response (forced choice)**, but **vanishes when that stimulus is ambiguous (free choice)**. Additional experiments demonstrate that **mere perception of response‑associated stimuli (no executed R2) can produce a BCE**, supporting an **automatic response‑feature activation** account (TEC) over a **global inhibition** account.

## Core goal

Are no‑go “nonactions” special inhibitory acts (requiring active suppression of a pre‑activated go response), or are they **responses with their own effect codes** that can be **automatically activated** by the stimulus, just like go responses? The authors adjudicate between a **Global Inhibition** account vs. an **Automatic Response‑Feature Activation** account (TEC).

## Setup at a glance

* **Paradigm:** [[Paradigm Classes/Dual-Task Performance & PRP|PRP]]; T1 = left‑hand choice (X/O → left/right key), T2 = tone‑based go/no‑go with right hand (Enter vs. no keypress). SOA ∈ {100, 200, 400 ms}. Tones 55 ms. [[Dimensions/Inter-task SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)|SOA]] manipulated to induce PRP.
* **Key DV:** **BCE** = RT1(no‑go in T2) – RT1(go in T2).
* **Data hygiene:** Excluded trials with **IRI ≤ 100 ms** to avoid response grouping; RT outliers trimmed.
* **Why this matters:** No‑go trials don’t yield RTs by definition; **BCE provides an indirect window** into the characteristics of "not responding."

## Experiments & main findings

### Experiment 1 — Between‑participants (forced vs. free T2)

* **Design:** Participants did PRP with either **forced** go/no‑go (tone uniquely mapped to go vs. no‑go) or **free** go/no‑go (one “decision” tone; participant chooses go/no‑go each trial).
* **Result:** Robust BCE in **forced** condition; **greatly reduced/near‑absent** in **free** condition (interaction: BCE 44 ms forced vs. 18 ms free). See **Fig. 2 (p. 601)** for RT1 split by R2 type.
  *Note:* RT2 was unexpectedly faster in free than forced; authors suspect some **pre‑planning** of response sequences in free choice.

### Experiment 2 — Within‑participants (forced and free intermixed)

* **Design tweak:** Forced/free intermixed to **discourage pre‑planning**.
* **Result:** Pattern replicates: **substantial BCE in forced (\~32 ms) and almost none in free (\~7 ms)**. See **Fig. 4 (p. 603)**.
  *Quality note:* The authors report sizeable exclusions based on IRI and error criteria (details reported), but the key interaction survives.

### Experiment 3a — Induction of response‑effect tones; single‑task compatibility test

* **Idea:** First **induce** go and no‑go **effect tones** via free‑choice action–tone pairings; then **use tones as primes** before a visual forced go/no‑go.
* **Result:** **Both go and no‑go effect tones** influenced speed in the subsequent visual task (compatibility effect), showing that **no‑go tones acquired response associations**. See **Fig. 6a (p. 607)**.

### Experiment 3b — Induced tones inside a (modified) PRP test

* **Idea:** After induction, **present the former go/no‑go tones as S2** in a PRP trial while a visual cue disambiguates whether to respond to S2. Critically, examine whether **tones alone (no executed R2)** elicit a BCE.
* **Result:** **Yes**—a BCE emerges **even without an executed T2 response**, especially at **SOA = 100 ms** (Tone main effect *F*(1,30)=6.58, *p*=.016; Tone×SOA *F*(2,60)=3.32, *p*=.043; **\~45 ms** at 100 ms SOA). See **Fig. 6b (p. 607)**.

## Interpretation

* **Against “global inhibition”**: If no‑go were chiefly an **active stop** of a mandatory go activation, BCEs should appear **both** when no‑go is forced and when it is freely chosen. They don’t.
* **For automatic feature activation (TEC):** The BCE arises when **S2 unambiguously activates response features** (go **or** no‑go) **in parallel** with T1 selection. Ambiguous S2 (free choice) **fails to trigger** a specific feature code, so **no BCE**. Experiments 3a/3b show **tones can carry no‑go codes** and elicit interference **even without an executed T2**, strengthening a **perception‑driven activation** account.
* **Bottom line:** **No‑go responses are conceptually equivalent to go responses**—they are generated by their **own action‑effect codes** rather than by suppressing pre‑activated go tendencies.

## Figures to remember (with page cues)

* **Fig. 1 (p. 600):** PRP in RT2; both groups show SOA effect; free‑choice RT2 unexpectedly faster.
* **Fig. 2 (p. 601):** **BCE in RT1**—clear in forced, minimal in free.
* **Fig. 3 & Fig. 4 (p. 603):** Within‑subject replication; BCE pattern holds under intermixed forced/free trials.
* **Fig. 6a–b (p. 607):** **Compatibility from induced tones** (3a) and **BCE from tones without executed R2** (3b).

## Methodological notes / caveats

* **Response grouping guarded against** via IRI ≤ 100 ms exclusion; authors also discuss the possibility that participants “waited” for S2 as a start impulse at short SOAs (even with grouping controlled), which can inflate SOA effects in RT1.
* **Unexpected RT2 advantage for free choice** in Exp. 1 hints at **pre‑planning**; Exp. 2 addresses this by intermixing trial types.
* **Participant exclusions** were non‑trivial in Exp. 2; worth keeping in mind when generalizing effect sizes.

## Coding

* **Paradigm:** [[Paradigm Classes/Dual-Task Performance & PRP|PRP]]
* **Key dimensions:** [[Dimensions/Inter-task SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)|SOA]] = {100, 200, 400}; **R2 Type:** go vs. no‑go; **T2 cue type:** forced (unambiguous) vs. free (ambiguous); **Response Set Overlap:** low (T1 left hand; T2 right hand/no press).
* **Mechanistic read:** BCE reflects **pre‑bottleneck feature activation** that interacts with T1’s feature activation, while **response selection remains serial**. (Aligns with central bottleneck logic; see Pashler and related PRP literature cited throughout.)

---

## Why it matters (connections)

* **Conceptual:** Strengthens the view (TEC) that **actions and nonactions share representational structure**; no‑go can be **selected via anticipated effects** (cf. nonaction‑effect binding).
* **Practical:** Provides a **tool to study nonactions** via their **indirect impact on T1**, solving the “no RT for no‑go” problem.
