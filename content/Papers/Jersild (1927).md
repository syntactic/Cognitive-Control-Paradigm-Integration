**Full Title:** Mental Set and Shift

**Author:** Arthur T. Jersild

**Year:** 1927

**Journal:** Archives of Psychology, No. 89

**Core Goal:**
Investigate "shift" (task alternation) vs. "mental set" (separate task performance) effects on efficiency:
1. Whether shift always reduces efficiency and varies across task combinations
2. Task difficulty effects on shift loss
3. Practice effects on shift efficiency  
4. Relationship between shifting ability and intelligence

**Paradigms:** Compared separate task performance ("mental set" baseline) vs. interleaved "shift" conditions. Primary measure: completion time.

**Key Task Combinations Explored (Chapter II):**

1.  **Calculation Tasks (Varying Difficulty):**
    *   **Adding and Multiplying:** Add two digits of a two-place number vs. Multiply the two digits. Shift: Alternate between adding and multiplying.
    *   **Add 6 / Subtract 3:** To/from two-place numbers. Shift: Alternate.
    *   **Add 14 / Subtract 7:** Shift: Alternate.
    *   **Add 17 / Subtract 13:** Shift: Alternate.
    *   **Add 1 / Subtract 1:** Shift: Alternate.
    *   *Initial Finding:* Greater relative shift loss for easier calculation problems.

2.  **Controlled Association:**
    *   Separate: Name opposites for 20 words; Name verb-objects for 20 words.
    *   Shift: Alternate naming opposites and verb-objects.
    *   *Finding:* Shift loss observed, reduced with practice. A variation with spatially separated lists for shift reduced loss significantly.

3.  **Controlled Association and Calculation:**
    *   Separate: Name opposites; Subtract 3 from numbers.
    *   Shift: Alternate naming opposites and subtracting 3.
    *   *Finding:* A *gain* in efficiency for the shift task (shift faster than sum of separate). Attributed to stimulus discriminability and breaking of interference.

4.  **Color Naming and Form Naming (Woodworth & Wells blanks):**
    *   Separate (Unique Method): Read all instances of one color/form throughout the blank (5 passes total), then the next color/form, etc.
    *   Shift: Read colors/forms in the order they appear on the blank (standard method).
    *   *Finding:* "Shift" (standard method) was slower than the sum of "separate" (reading one category at a time). Jersild attributes this to the practice inherent in the "separate" method of focusing on one stimulus type repeatedly.

5.  **Color Naming and Form Naming (Combined Shift):**
    *   Tasks: Color Naming, Form Naming.
    *   Shift: Alternate between naming the color of an item and the form of the next item.
    *   *Finding:* Small percentage of loss. Jersild argues the "shift" within each separate task (going from one color to a different color, or one form to a different form) is already high, so adding alternation between task *types* doesn't add much more loss.

6.  **Color Naming, Form Naming, Naming Opposites, Subtracting 3 (Combined Shift):**
    *   Shift: Alternate between all four task types.
    *   *Finding:* Practically no loss or even a slight gain compared to sum of separate tasks. Jersild attributes this to facilitation from stimulus discriminability and breaking of interference chains from continuous single-task performance.

7.  **Form Naming and Substitution:**
    *   Stimulus: Geometric form.
    *   Tasks: Name the form; Name an arbitrarily associated digit (substitution).
    *   Shift: Alternate naming form and substituting digit for the *same* form.
    *   *Finding:* High percentage of loss (22.5%). Attributed to associative interference (same stimulus, two responses).

8.  **Cancellation and Adding by 2's and 3's (Briefly Mentioned):**
    *   Cancellation (cross out 5s, circle 4s, then alternate): Small loss (2%).
    *   Adding by 2s vs 3s (then alternate): Shift test showed lower score (time limit method).

**Key Concepts & Terminology by Jersild:**
*   **Mental Set:** Proficiency/state for performing a single, uniform task.
*   **Shift:** The act or requirement of alternating between different mental sets/operations.
*   **Shift Loss/Gain:** Percentage difference in time/efficiency between shift performance and combined separate task performance.
*   **Separate-Tasks Shift:** The inherent adjustments required even within a nominally uniform task (e.g., moving from one addition problem to the next).
*   **Combined-Tasks Shift:** The adjustments required when alternating between two or more distinct types of operations.

**Key Findings & Conclusions:**

1.  **Shift Does Not Always Cause Loss:** While often true, combining tasks did not invariably lead to a loss in efficiency. Some combinations (e.g., Association + Calculation; 4-way combination) showed a gain.
2.  **Practice Effects:** Practice generally reduced shift loss. In some cases (Controlled Association), the loss almost disappeared after one trial. In others (Form Naming & Substitution), a significant loss persisted even after practice.
3.  **Task Difficulty & Shift Loss (Calculation Tasks):** Easier calculation tasks showed a *greater relative* shift loss than more difficult ones. Jersild attributes this to the higher degree of automatization/practice in the easy separate tasks, making the disruption of "unpractised" alternation more pronounced.
4.  **Stimulus Discriminability & Associative Aids:** Shift is facilitated (loss is less) when stimuli for the alternating tasks are clearly different (e.g., word vs. number) or when spatial cues aid the alternation. Shift loss is greater when the same stimulus demands different responses (e.g., Form Naming & Substitution).
5.  **Nature of Shift:** Jersild argues against shift being a single, distinct "factor" or a fixed time cost. Instead, he views it as an integral part of the adaptational processes involved in all mental activity. The "shift" in a combined task differs in degree, not necessarily in kind, from the adjustments needed within a "uniform" task.
6.  **Overlapping and Interference:** These factors, common in continuous single-task performance, can be *broken* or *reduced* when tasks are alternated, sometimes leading to a net gain in the shift condition if the benefit of breaking interference outweighs the cost of alternation.
7.  **Intelligence & Shift:** Jersild (Chapter IV, not OCR'd here but outlined in his TOC) planned to explore this, expecting more intelligent individuals to be more adaptable/better at shifting.

**Relevance to Thesis:**

*   **Historical Importance:** An early, comprehensive study of task switching phenomena, predating much of the modern terminology but covering many core concepts.
*   **[[Dimensions/Switch Rate|Switch Rate]]:** All his "shift" conditions involve a 100% switch rate (alternating on every item or every other item).
*   **[[Number of Tasks|Number of Tasks]]:** All experiments are Number of Tasks=1 per response, but the "pool" of tasks being alternated varies (2 to 4).
*   **[[Dimensions/Stimulus-Stimulus Congruency]]:** Highly relevant in the Form Naming & Substitution task (same stimulus, two different task rules/responses). Also implicitly present in calculation tasks where a number like '64' could be subject to 'add digits' or 'multiply digits'.
*   **[[Dimensions/Response Set Overlap|Response Set Overlap]]:** Varied implicitly. E.g., Calculation tasks often use the same output modality (written numbers). Form Naming vs. Substitution involves different response *types* to the same stimulus.
*   **[[Dimensions/Task Cue Type|Task Cue Type]]:** Implicit (determined by alternating sequence).
*   **Task Difficulty:** Jersild's finding that easier tasks can show greater *relative* shift loss is an important and counterintuitive point that theories of practice and automaticity must address.
*   **Mapping Challenges:**
    *   His "separate task" method for Color/Form naming (reading all reds, then all greens) is unusual and makes direct comparison to modern "pure block" baselines difficult. It introduces its own kind of serial search and less direct item-to-item shifting.
    *   The variety of tasks (calculations, associations, naming) would need to be abstracted to SE's 'mov'/'or' for SE parameterization, focusing on the structural aspects of switching.
    *   The "number of processes" (e.g., combining 4 tasks) pushes the boundary of SE's 2-task design, similar to the Rubin & Meiran (2005) MWBC condition, if we consider the size of the task pool. However, since it's always an alternation between *two* of these at any given micro-moment in some designs, or a fixed sequence, it might be partially mappable by focusing on pairwise switches.
