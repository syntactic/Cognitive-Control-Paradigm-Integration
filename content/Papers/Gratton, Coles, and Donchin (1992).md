**Core Goal:** Test whether subjects exert strategic, top-down control over conflict processing. Used [[Canonical Tasks/Flanker Task|Flanker paradigm]] to investigate strategic choice between early "parallel" processing (flanker-sensitive) vs. later "focused" processing (flanker-filtered) based on stimulus expectancies.

### Paradigm & General Method
*   **Paradigm:** A letter-based [[Canonical Tasks/Flanker Task|Flanker Task]].
*   **Task:** Participants made a speeded response (hand squeeze) to a central target letter (e.g., 'H' or 'S').
*   **Stimuli (Noise Arrays):**
    *   **Compatible:** The target was surrounded by identical letters (e.g., HHHHH).
    *   **Incompatible:** The target was surrounded by letters associated with the opposite response (e.g., SSSHS).
*   **Core Underlying Model:** The authors propose a two-phase processing model:
    1.  **Parallel Phase (Early):** A fast, initial analysis of the entire stimulus array. Because the noise letters are more numerous, this phase tends to activate a response corresponding to the flankers.
    2.  **Focused Phase (Late):** A slower, subsequent analysis where attention is narrowed to the target's location, allowing the correct response to be determined while ignoring the flankers.

### Key Manipulations & Hypotheses
The study used three different methods across its experiments to manipulate the participant's expectancy about whether the upcoming trial would be compatible or incompatible.

1.  **Experiment 1 (Sequential Effects):** Analyzed the effect of the previous trial's noise type on the current trial's performance. It was hypothesized that a compatible trial would create an expectancy for another compatible trial, leading subjects to rely more on the fast, parallel strategy.
2.  **Experiment 2 (Global Probability):** Manipulated the overall probability of compatible vs. incompatible trials across different blocks (e.g., a block with 75% compatible trials vs. one with 25%). It was hypothesized that subjects would adapt their strategy to the block-wide statistics.
3.  **Experiments 3a & 3b (Conditional Probability / Cued):** Provided an explicit symbolic cue 1500ms before the stimulus array, which informed the participant of the probability that the upcoming trial would be compatible or incompatible. This directly tested if subjects could use a top-down signal to adjust their strategy on a trial-by-trial basis.

### Key Findings
*   **Strategic Modulation Confirmed:** Across all experiments, the noise-compatibility effect (the RT and error difference between incompatible and compatible trials) was significantly modulated by expectancy.
*   **Larger Interference with Compatible Expectancy:** When subjects expected a compatible trial (e.g., following a compatible trial, in a high-probability compatible block, or after a predictive cue), the interference effect was *larger*. This is because they adopted the fast "parallel" strategy, making them quicker on compatible trials but much more prone to errors and delays on the unexpected incompatible trials.
*   **Smaller Interference with Incompatible Expectancy:** When subjects expected an incompatible trial, the interference effect was *smaller*. They strategically adopted the slower, more cautious "focused" strategy, which reduced the cost on incompatible trials at the expense of being slightly slower on compatible trials.
*   **ERP Evidence:** The study used the Lateralized Readiness Potential (LRP) to show evidence of incorrect response activation preceding the correct response on incompatible trials, supporting their two-phase model.

### Authors' Main Conclusions
*   The processing of conflicting information is not automatic and immutable. Subjects can exert strategic, top-down control over how they respond to it.
*   This control is based on a **utility principle**: subjects adjust their strategy (relying on the parallel vs. focused phase) based on the expected utility (i.e., the best trade-off between speed and accuracy) given the current context.
*   Expectancies, whether generated by recent trial history, block-level probabilities, or explicit cues, can drive this strategic adjustment.

### Relevance to Thesis & Mapping Notes
*   **Paradigm Type:** This is a classic [[Paradigm Classes/Interference Control|Interference Control]] paradigm, specifically a Flanker task.
*   **Dimensional Relevance:**
    *   **[[Dimensions/Stimulus-Stimulus Congruency]]:** The core manipulation is between `Congruent` (compatible) and `Incongruent` (incompatible) conditions.
    *   **[[Dimensions/CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]]:** Experiment 3 provides a clear example of using a long CSI (1500ms) to study preparatory effects.
    *   **[[Dimensions/Task Cue Type|Task Cue Type]]:** Experiment 3 uses an `Arbitrary` symbolic cue.
*   **Theoretical Importance:** This paper is crucial because it demonstrates that the magnitude of a "bottom-up" interference effect can be modulated by "top-down" strategic control. It highlights the dynamic and adaptive nature of [[Cognitive Control]].
*   **Mapping Considerations:** The different experimental conditions that manipulate expectancy (sequential, block probability, cued) would be coded as separate sets of rows in the spreadsheet. For instance, the "75% compatible" block from Experiment 2 would be represented by two rows: one for the compatible trials within that block and one for the incompatible trials. This allows the PCA to capture the different behavioral outcomes that arise from the same physical stimuli under different contextual expectancies.
*   This paper's findings on sequential adjustments are a primary behavioral phenomenon explained by the [[Theoretical Concepts/Conflict Monitoring Theory]].
