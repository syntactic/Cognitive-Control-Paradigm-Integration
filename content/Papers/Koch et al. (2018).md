**Core Argument/Goal:**  
This comprehensive review argues that research on [[Dual-Task Performance & PRP|dual-task performance]] (especially PRP) and [[Task Switching]] has largely proceeded in separate silos, despite both investigating fundamental aspects of human multitasking. The authors advocate for an integrative perspective, organizing the complex literature around three complementary themes:

1. **Cognitive Structure:** Focuses on inherent architectural limitations, often conceptualized as processing [[Bottleneck Theories|bottlenecks]] (dominant in dual-task research).
2. **Cognitive Flexibility:** Focuses on the control processes enabling adaptation to changing demands, such as [[Task-Set Reconfiguration]], managing [[Crosstalk]], and preparatory adjustments (dominant in task-switching research).
3. **Cognitive Plasticity:** Focuses on how practice and learning modify multitasking abilities, affecting both structure and flexibility.

The paper aims to highlight similarities in underlying mechanisms and promote a unified understanding of multitasking.

**Key Concepts & Paradigms Discussed:**

- **Dual-Task/PRP Perspective (Emphasis on Structure):**
    
    - Detailed overview of the [[Dual-Task Performance & PRP|PRP paradigm]] and the evidence supporting a central [[Bottleneck Theories|bottleneck]], often localized at [[Response Selection Bottleneck (RSB)|response selection]].
    - Discussion of the "locus-of-slack" logic for identifying bottleneck stages by manipulating task difficulty.
    - Acknowledges challenges to strict serial bottlenecks, such as evidence for parallel processing, [[Crosstalk]], modality effects ([[Response Set Overlap]]), and [[Backward Crosstalk Effect (BCE)]].
    - Discusses the concept of flexible capacity sharing as an alternative/complement to strict bottlenecks.
    - Mentions higher-level executive control of task order (citing Luria & Meiran, Hirsch et al.).
- **Task Switching Perspective (Emphasis on Flexibility/Control):**
    
    - Focuses on [[Switch Cost]] and [[Mixing Cost]] as key phenomena.
    - Discusses [[Task-Set Reconfiguration]] (active control) versus [[Task-Set Inertia]] (passive carry-over/priming) accounts.
    - Reviews evidence for preparatory effects based on [[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)]] and passive decay based on RSI.
    - Highlights the role of inhibition (n-2 costs/backward inhibition).
    - Discusses [[Interference Control]] within task switching, particularly [[Dimensions/Stimulus-Stimulus Congruency|task-rule congruency effects]] and the role of [[Response Set Overlap]].
        
- **Plasticity Perspective (Practice Effects):**
    
    - Reviews studies showing practice reduces both dual-task costs/[[PRP Effect]] (e.g., Schumacher et al. 2001) and [[Switch Cost]]s (e.g., Rogers & Monsell 1995).
    - Discusses theoretical accounts: stage shortening, task automatization, improved task coordination/integration.
    - Mentions near and far transfer effects of multitasking training.

**Key Differences Highlighted Between Fields:**

- **Historical Focus:** Dual-task research initially focused more on structural bottlenecks, while task-switching research focused more on flexible control and reconfiguration processes.
- **Role of Preparation:** Advance preparation ([[Preparation and Pre-cuing]]) is a central topic in task switching (via CSI) but has received less attention historically within the standard PRP framework.
- **Inhibition:** Concepts like backward inhibition (n-2 cost) are prominent in task switching but less explicitly studied in standard PRP/dual-task paradigms.

**Relevance to Thesis:**

- **Primary Source:** This paper is a cornerstone reference for understanding the theoretical landscape, key phenomena, and standard methodologies in both dual-task and task-switching research.
- **Integrative Goal:** Directly supports the thesis goal of bridging these paradigms and mapping the [[Parametric Design Space]].
- **Dimensional Relevance:** Discusses the impact of many of the identified [[Derived Dimensions vs. Low-Level Parameters|derived dimensions]], including [[Inter-task SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)]], [[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)]], [[Dimensions/Stimulus-Stimulus Congruency|S-S Congruency]] and [[Dimensions/Stimulus-Response Congruency|S-R Congruency]], [[Response Set Overlap]] (via modality), and practice effects (related to plasticity).
- **Identifies Key Studies:** Cites many of the foundational and contemporary papers relevant for detailed literature mapping (e.g., Pashler, Meyer & Kieras, Rogers & Monsell, Meiran, Allport, Hommel, Logan, etc.).
- **Highlights Theoretical Tensions:** Clearly outlines the debates (e.g., serial bottleneck vs. parallel capacity sharing; reconfiguration vs. inertia) that the design space map aims to contextualize.
