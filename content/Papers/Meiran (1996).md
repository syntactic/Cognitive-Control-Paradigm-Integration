**Core Goal:**  
To provide strong evidence for an active, time-consuming process of task-set reconfiguration that can occur prior to stimulus presentation (i.e., during preparation) in task switching, distinct from passive carry-over effects (like [[Task-Set Inertia]]). Introduces and validates the explicit task-cuing paradigm with variable [[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)]] for this purpose.

**Experiment Definition:**

- **Explicit Task-Cuing Paradigm:** Participants switched between two spatial judgment tasks (Up/Down vs. Left/Right) based on an explicit cue (arrow direction) presented before the target stimulus (a dot in one of four locations).
- [[Number of Tasks|Number of Tasks=1]] per trial, [[Switch Rate]] typically 50% (random cuing).
- [[Response Set Overlap]] = Identical (Left/Right keypresses for both tasks).
- [[Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|Stimulus Bivalence]] = Bivalent-Neutral (Target location affords judgments on both dimensions).
- [[Task Cue Type]] = Arbitrary (arrow direction maps to spatial judgment axis).

**Key Manipulations:**

1. **Cue-Stimulus Interval (CSI):** Systematically varied the time between the onset of the task cue (arrow) and the onset of the target stimulus (dot). Ranges varied across experiments (e.g., 100ms to 1100ms).
2. **Response-Cue Interval (RCI):** The time between the previous response and the current cue was also implicitly varied or controlled in some analyses to disentangle preparation from decay.
3. **Task Shift vs. Task Repeat:** Compared performance on trials where the cued task differed from the previous trial versus trials where it was the same.

**Key Findings:**

- **Robust Switch Costs:** Replicated the standard [[Switch Cost]] effect â€“ RTs were slower on task-switch trials than task-repeat trials, especially at short CSI.
- **CSI Reduces Switch Costs:** Increasing the CSI significantly reduced the magnitude of the switch cost. This reduction followed a negatively accelerating curve, with most benefit gained by ~600ms.
- **Large Residual Switch Cost:** Critically, switch costs were not eliminated even at the longest CSIs used (e.g., 1100ms). A substantial residual cost remained.
- **Preparation Affects Repeats Too:** RTs on repeat trials also decreased with increasing CSI, although typically less than switch trials, indicating general preparation effects beyond switch-specific reconfiguration.
- **RCI Effects Minimal/Dissociated:** The study argued (in later experiments and discussion, though Exp 1 confounds CSI/RCI) that the reduction in switch cost was primarily due to CSI (active preparation), not just increased RCI (passive decay), although decay might play a role.

**Author's Main Conclusions/Interpretations:**

- Task switching involves an active, time-consuming **advance reconfiguration** process that can be engaged during the CSI, reducing switch costs.
- This reconfiguration process cannot typically be fully completed before stimulus onset, resulting in a **residual switch cost**. This residual component might reflect stimulus-triggered completion of reconfiguration or potentially [[Task-Set Inertia]].
- The task-cuing paradigm successfully isolates preparatory reconfiguration effects from simple stimulus/response priming or passive decay effects (when RCI is controlled or accounted for).

**Relevance to Thesis:**

- **Methodological Importance:** Introduces the explicit **task-cuing paradigm with variable CSI** as a primary tool for studying preparation effects in task switching, contrasting with the alternating runs/RSI manipulation in [[Rogers & Monsell (1995)]].
- **Dimensional Relevance:** Directly informs the [[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)]] dimension and its impact on [[Switch Cost]]. Also relevant to [[Number of Tasks]], [[Switch Rate]] (typically 50% random), [[Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]] (uses bivalent), [[Response Set Overlap]] (uses identical), and [[Task Cue Type]] (uses arbitrary).
- **Theoretical Importance:** Provides strong evidence for **active preparation (reconfiguration)** in task switching. Reinforces the concept of a **residual switch cost** that preparation time alone cannot eliminate, a key phenomenon the theoretical map needs to accommodate. Sets the stage for debates about the nature of this residual cost (incomplete endogenous reconfiguration vs. stimulus-driven completion vs. inertia).
**Exclusions**:
- Meiran 1996's experiments manipulated not involved having bivalent stimuli in the tasks being switched, but also compatible and incompatible stimulus response mappings. This means that there were trial types where the participant saw a stimulus in the lower left quadrant or upper right quadrant and had to press a key that was incompatible with the spatial location of the stimulus. For example, in the up-down task, if the participant saw the stimulus in the lower left, they might have to press '7' (compatible with up and left and incompatible with down and right). Right now the Meiran experiments are all coded as having arbitrary SRM but ideally they would all be coded with more fidelity. This compatibility was expressly manipulated in experiment 3 and for this reason I have excluded it from the spreadsheet, but in theory we could add it in.
- Experiment 4 intended to see the effect of practice effects - both the experiment length was longer and the warm-up procedure was emphasized to improve accuracy. Because these are not necessarily manipulations we can make in the SE, I have excluded experiment 4.
