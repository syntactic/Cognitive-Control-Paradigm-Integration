### Core Contribution to Thesis Project

This paper provides a foundational theoretical framework for stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) that serves as a direct intellectual precursor to this thesis project's goal of creating a unified design space. It argues that many disparate SRC phenomena can be explained by a single model based on the concept of "Dimensional Overlap." This paper is not coded in the CSV as its value is purely theoretical and its experimental details are superseded by more modern paradigms we have included.

### Key Concepts Relevant to Our Framework

1.  **Dimensional Overlap as the Basis for Bivalence:** The paper's central concept is **Dimensional Overlap**, the idea that compatibility effects only arise when the stimulus and response sets share common representational dimensions (e.g., both are spatial, both are semantic). This is the direct theoretical justification for our `[[Dimensions/Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]]` dimension. In our terms, a stimulus becomes **bivalent** precisely when such an overlap exists, creating the potential for conflict.

2.  **A Processing Model for the Congruency Effect:** Kornblum et al. propose a two-pathway processing model for stimuli with dimensional overlap: an **automatic activation** of the corresponding response, and a controlled **response identification** based on the instructed rule. The [[Effects/Congruency Effect|congruency effect]] arises from the conflict between these pathways, where an incongruent automatic activation must be "aborted." This model is a clear forerunner to the [[Theoretical Concepts/Conflict Monitoring Theory]] and provides a mechanistic explanation for the phenomena we are mapping.

3.  **A Taxonomy as a Precursor to the Parametric Space:** The authors propose a taxonomy of task ensembles (p. 264, Table 2) based on whether dimensional overlap occurs on relevant or irrelevant dimensions. This taxonomy, which classifies paradigms like the [[Canonical Tasks/Stroop Task|Stroop Task]] (Type 2) and [[Canonical Tasks/Simon Task|Simon Task]] (Type 3) into a common framework, is a powerful early validation of our thesis's core goal: to unify paradigms based on their underlying structural properties in a [[Parametric Design Space]].
