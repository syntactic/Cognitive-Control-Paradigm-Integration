**Full Title:** Studies of Interference in Serial Verbal Reactions

**Author:** J. Ridley Stroop

**Year:** 1935

**Journal:** Journal of Experimental Psychology

**Core Goal:**
Quantify interference when color names and ink colors conflict:
1. Color stimuli interfering with reading color names
2. Word stimuli interfering with naming ink colors  
3. Practice effects on interference

**Paradigm(s) Used & Key Manipulations:**

**Experiment 1: Reading Color Names**
*   **Task:** Read color names
*   **Conditions:** 
    *   RCNd: Color names in conflicting ink colors (Incongruent)
    *   RCNb: Color names in black ink (N/A)
*   **Key Dimensions:** [[Dimensions/Task 2 Response Probability]]=0.0, [[Dimensions/Stimulus-Stimulus Congruency]]=Incongruent/N/A

**Experiment 2: Naming Ink Colors**
*   **Task:** Name ink colors
*   **Conditions:**
    *   NCWd: Color words in conflicting ink colors (Incongruent)
    *   NC: Color patches only (N/A)
*   **Key Dimensions:** [[Dimensions/Task 2 Response Probability]]=0.0, [[Dimensions/Stimulus-Stimulus Congruency]]=Incongruent/N/A

**Experiment 3: The Effects of Practice upon Interference**
*   **Tasks & Stimuli:** Similar to Exp 1 (RCNd) and Exp 2 (NCWd, NC with swastikas).
*   **Manipulation:** Participants underwent 8 days of practice naming the ink colors of conflicting color words (NCWd task).
*   **Measures:** Performance on NCWd, NC, and RCNd tests before, during, and after the practice period.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Color→Word interference:** Small effect (5.6% increase)
2. **Word→Color interference:** Large, robust Stroop effect (74.3% increase)  
3. **Practice effects:** Reduced but didn't eliminate interference; strengthened color pathway increased reverse Stroop effect

**Main Conclusions:**
Word reading is more automatic than color naming due to extensive practice, causing asymmetrical interference. Practice can modify but not eliminate this fundamental asymmetry.

**Relevance to Thesis:**
*   Seminal [[Effects/Stroop Effect|Stroop effect]] paper defining [[Paradigm Classes/Interference Control]]
*   Exemplifies [[Dimensions/Stimulus-Stimulus Congruency]] Incongruent vs. N/A conditions  
*   SE mapping: Single-task ([[Dimensions/Task 2 Response Probability]]=0.0) with simultaneous target/distractor presentation (SOA=0)
*   Demonstrates task automaticity effects and plasticity through practice
