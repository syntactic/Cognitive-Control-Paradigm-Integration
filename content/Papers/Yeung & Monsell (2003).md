**Full Title:** Switching Between Tasks of Unequal Familiarity: The Role of Stimulus-Attribute and Response-Set Selection

**Authors:** Nick Yeung, Stephen Monsell

**Year:** 2003

**Journal:** Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance

**Core Goal:**
To investigate the "paradoxical" asymmetry in [[Effects/Switch Cost|Switch Costs]] reported by Allport et al. (1994), where it can be harder to switch to a stronger, well-practiced task than to a weaker one. The authors explore whether this asymmetry is dependent on the level of between-task interference and how manipulations aimed at reducing interference (by facilitating stimulus-attribute selection or separating response sets) affect switch costs.

**Paradigm(s) Used:**
[[Task Switching]] paradigms, primarily using:
-   **Experiment 1:** Stroop-like tasks â€“ switching between color naming (weaker) and word naming (stronger). Stimuli were words on colored rectangles.
-   **Experiments 2a & 2b:** Switching between digit naming (stronger) and a derived digit task (weaker):
    -   Exp 2a: Odd/Even classification.
    -   Exp 2b: Tens-complement naming (e.g., "3" -> "seven").
-   **Experiment 3:** Switching between digit naming (stronger, vocal response) and color naming (weaker, varied response modality/category).

**Key Manipulations:**

1.  **Stimulus Attribute Onset Asynchrony (SOA within stimulus, Exp 1):** The onset of the word attribute was delayed relative to the color patch onset (0ms, 160ms, or 320ms delay). This was *not* a traditional trial-to-trial SOA or a CSI, but a manipulation to make selection of the color attribute easier by giving it a temporal advantage.
2.  **[[Dimensions/Response Set Overlap|Response Set Overlap]] (Exp 2 & 3):**
    *   **Exp 2a (Digit Naming vs. Odd/Even):** Different response categories (digit names vs. "odd"/"even"), same modality (vocal). *Result: Disjoint by category.*
    *   **Exp 2b (Digit Naming vs. Tens-Complement):** Same response categories (digit names), same modality (vocal). *Result: Identical.*
    *   **Exp 3 (Digit Naming vs. Color Naming):** Systematically varied overlap:
        *   **Full Overlap:** Spoken digit names for strong task; spoken digit names (arbitrarily mapped) for weak task.
        *   **Modality Overlap (Category Disjoint):** Spoken digit names (strong); spoken direction words (arbitrarily mapped) for color (weak).
        *   **Category Overlap (Modality Disjoint):** Spoken digit names (strong); manual keypresses 1-4 (arbitrarily mapped) for color (weak).
        *   **No Overlap:** Spoken digit names (strong); manual keypresses for directions (arbitrarily mapped) for color (weak).
3.  **Task Strength/Familiarity:** Inherently manipulated by choosing tasks like word/digit naming (strong) versus color naming, odd/even, or tens-complement (weaker).
4. [[RSI (Response Stimulus Interval)]]: 1000ms (Exp 1), 1200ms (Exp 2), 1000ms (Exp 3)

**Key Findings:**

1.  **Replication of Allport's Asymmetry (High Interference):**
    *   When interference was high (simultaneous attribute presentation in Exp 1; shared responses in Exp 2b and Full Overlap in Exp 3), switch costs were larger for switching *to the stronger task* (e.g., word naming, digit naming).
2.  **Reversal of Asymmetry (Reduced Interference):**
    *   **Exp 1 (Delayed Attribute):** Delaying word onset (reducing interference for color naming) reversed the asymmetry. Switch costs became larger for switching *to the weaker color-naming task*.
    *   **Exp 2a (Disjoint Response Categories):** Switching between digit naming and odd/even (different vocal responses) resulted in a larger switch cost for the *weaker odd/even task*.
    *   **Exp 3 (Separated Response Sets):** When response sets were separated by modality or category (Modality Overlap, Category Overlap, No Overlap conditions), the switch cost asymmetry reversed: costs were larger for switching *to the weaker color-naming task*.
3.  **Interference Reduction:** The manipulations (delayed attribute, separated responses) generally reduced overall interference (e.g., Stroop effect size), but the key finding was the *reversal* of switch cost asymmetry, not necessarily its elimination.
4.  **Modelling:** The authors propose a model where task activation is a function of task strength (baseline), control input (top-down bias), and task priming (carry-over). Asymmetrical priming (larger priming after a weak task because it required more control) combined with minimization of control effort can explain both patterns of asymmetry. When interference is high, overcoming it for the weak task leads to strong carry-over priming that then interferes more when switching back to the strong task. When interference is low, less control is needed for the weak task, leading to less carry-over, and the inherent difficulty of activating the weaker task set becomes more dominant.

**Authors' Main Conclusions/Interpretations:**

-   The paradoxical asymmetry in switch costs (larger cost to switch to a stronger task) is not a universal feature of task switching but is characteristic of situations with **high between-task interference** (stemming from stimulus attribute overlap and/or response set overlap).
-   When interference between tasks is reduced, the asymmetry reverses, and it becomes harder to switch to the **weaker, less practiced, or less dominant task**. This aligns more with intuitive notions of task-set inertia or reconfiguration difficulty.
-   The results support models where switch costs arise from an interaction between **task priming (carry-over activation/inhibition) and endogenous control processes** that are adjusted based on task demands and interference levels.
-   Separating response sets is an effective way to "gate out" interference from an irrelevant task, thereby changing the dynamics of switch costs.

**Relevance to Thesis:**

-   **Critical for [[Dimensions/Response Set Overlap|Response Set Overlap]]:** Provides direct empirical evidence on how different degrees and types of response set overlap (identical, category-disjoint, modality-disjoint, fully disjoint) modulate [[Effects/Switch Cost|Switch Costs]] and their asymmetry.
-   **Informs [[Dimensions/Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]]:** Experiment 1, by manipulating the temporal distinctiveness of stimulus attributes, addresses a form of stimulus-level interference that impacts congruency and selection.
-   **Nuances Asymmetric Switch Costs:** Moves beyond a simple "stronger task always harder to switch to" by showing this is context-dependent (high interference). This is a key refinement of the Allport et al. (1994) findings.
-   **Interaction of Factors:** Demonstrates the interplay between task strength, interference levels (due to stimulus and response factors), and control processes in determining switching performance.
-   **Mapping to Super Experiment:**
    *   Exp 1's SOA-within-stimulus is tricky for SE. SE's `start_mov_1` vs `start_or_1` could simulate attributes appearing at different times, but SE's cueing is tied to the *task*, not individual attributes within a bivalent stimulus for one task. This might be a limitation or require careful interpretation for SE mapping.
    -   The Super Experiment's client UI (`index.html`, `experiment.js`) allows direct selection of "Identical" or "Disjoint" response set relationships.
    -   **"Identical" in SE** (same keys for same conceptual responses, e.g., 'a'/'d' for left/right for both tasks) can model:
        -   Their "Full Overlap" condition (Exp 3), where both tasks used spoken digit names.
        -   Their "Tens-Complement Naming" vs. "Digit Naming" (Exp 2b), where both used spoken digit names (Identical response categories).
    -   **"Disjoint" in SE** (e.g., 'a'/'d' for movement task, 'w'/'s' for orientation task) can model:
        -   Their "No Overlap" condition (Exp 3: spoken digits vs. manual direction keys). This is a good mapping as SE uses different keys for different conceptual dimensions.
        -   Their "Category Overlap" (Exp 3: spoken digits vs. manual digit keys) can be approximated if one conceptual dimension (e.g., digit identity) is mapped to different effectors/key groups.
        -   Their "Modality Overlap" (Exp 3: spoken digits vs. spoken directions) is harder to map directly since SE is keypress-based, but the "Orthogonal" setting (distinct key groups for distinct conceptual dimensions) captures the essence of disjoint response categories within the same manual modality.
        -   Their "Odd/Even Classification" vs. "Digit Naming" (Exp 2a), though both vocal, used different response categories. "Orthogonal" in SE (mapping to different key groups) is the closest analogy for distinct response categories.
    -   The SE's `movementKeyMap` and `orientationKeyMap` are dynamically configured by `experiment.js` based on the UI selection, allowing these different overlap conditions to be set up more directly.
