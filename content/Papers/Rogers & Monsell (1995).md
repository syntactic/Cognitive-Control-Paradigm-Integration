**Core Goal:**  
To investigate the nature of the [[Switch Cost]] in predictable [[Task Switching]] by manipulating the preparation time available between tasks (using the Response-Stimulus Interval, RSI) and examining the role of stimulus-driven effects. Introduces the AABB alternating runs paradigm.

**Experiment Definition:**

- [[Task Switching]] using the **Alternating Runs Paradigm** (AABB sequence).
- Tasks: Primarily Letter classification (Consonant/Vowel) vs. Digit classification (Odd/Even) using letter-digit pair stimuli (e.g., G7). Task cued implicitly by spatial location.
- Responses: Manual Left/Right keypresses ([[Response Set Overlap|Identical]]).

**Key Manipulations:**

1. **Response-Stimulus Interval (RSI):** Varied the time between the response on trial N-1 and the stimulus on trial N.
    - Exp 2: Random RSI (150-1200ms).
    - Exp 3 & 4: Constant RSI within blocks (varied between blocks: 150, 300, 450, 600, 1200ms).
2. **Stimulus Irrelevant Character Type (Exp 5):** Compared trials where the irrelevant character was associated with the competing task set (e.g., digit '7' on a letter trial for 'G7' - [[Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|Bivalent-Congruent/Incongruent]]) vs. where it was a neutral symbol '#' ([[Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|Bivalent-Neutral]]).
3. **Run Length (Exp 6):** Compared AABB sequence with AAAABBBB sequence.

**Key Findings:**

- **Substantial Switch Costs:** Confirmed large RT and error [[Switch Cost]]s even with perfectly predictable switches.
- **Preparation Reduces Costs (RSI Effect):** When RSI was constant and predictable (Exp 3/4), switch costs decreased as RSI increased up to ~600ms. This supports a role for endogenous [[Preparation and Pre-cuing|preparation]] or [[Task-Set Reconfiguration]].
- **No Benefit from Unpredictable RSI:** When RSI varied randomly (Exp 2), increasing RSI had no effect on switch costs, suggesting preparation requires temporal predictability.
- **Large Residual Switch Cost:** Critically, switch costs were not eliminated even with very long preparation intervals (1200ms RSI in Exp 3/4). A substantial cost remained.
- **Exogenous Cuing/Interference:** Switch costs were larger when the irrelevant stimulus character was associated with the competing task compared to when it was neutral (Exp 5). Suggests stimuli exogenously activate associated task sets.
- **Switch Cost Localization:** The performance cost was almost entirely localized to the first trial of a run (the actual switch trial); performance on subsequent repetition trials (e.g., trial 2, 3, 4 in AAAABBBB) was similar (Exp 6).

**Authors' Main Conclusions/Interpretations:**

- Switch costs have (at least) two components:
    - An **endogenous component:** Reflects active [[Task-Set Reconfiguration]], which can be performed partially in advance if sufficient, predictable preparation time ([[RSI]]) is available.
    - An **exogenous component:** Reflects processes triggered by the stimulus itself, potentially completing reconfiguration or overcoming interference. This component is responsible for the [[Residual Switch Cost]].
- Rejected simple decay accounts. Argued against the idea that switch costs solely reflect the duration of a single inserted reconfiguration stage.
- Leaned towards [[Task-Set Inertia]] (proactive interference from the previous set) as a major contributor to the residual cost, potentially requiring stimulus arrival to be overcome, but didn't fully commit against stimulus-cued completion.

**Relevance to Thesis:**

- **Foundational TS Paper:** Establishes the alternating runs paradigm and the key finding of reducible but persistent (residual) switch costs with preparation time (RSI).
- **Dimensions:** Directly informs [[Switch Rate]] (predictable alternation), [[Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]] (via Exp 5), [[Response Set Overlap]] (Identical), [[Task Cue Type]] (Implicit), and the effect of preparation time (RSI, analogous to [[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]]).
- **Theoretical Importance:** Provides strong evidence against models where switch costs are solely due to a fully endogenous preparation process that can be completed given sufficient time. Highlights the role of stimulus-driven effects and/or persistent interference ([[Task-Set Inertia]]). Key paper for contrasting [[Task-Set Reconfiguration]] and [[Task-Set Inertia]] accounts.
