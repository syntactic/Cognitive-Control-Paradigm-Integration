### A Deeper Look at Stimulus-Stimulus Conflict

While the primary analysis in this thesis groups paradigms like the [[Canonical Tasks/Stroop Task]] and [[Canonical Tasks/Flanker Task]] under the unified dimension of [[Dimensions/Stimulus-Stimulus Congruency]], a more nuanced distinction exists that is critical for a full theoretical discussion. This is the distinction between **within-object conflict** and **between-object conflict**.

This concept captures the difference in how conflicting stimulus attributes are presented spatially, an idea I first called the degree of attribute "stacking" before I saw the terms "within-object conflict" and "between-object conflict".

#### 1. Within-Object Conflict

*   **Definition:** Conflict arises from multiple, competing attributes that are integral features of a **single object or stimulus**. The attributes are maximally "stacked" or spatially collocated.
*   **Canonical Example:** The [[Canonical Tasks/Stroop Task]]. The word "RED" and the ink color "blue" are inextricably bound to the same stimulus. One cannot selectively attend to the spatial location of the color without also attending to the location of the word.
*   **Cognitive Mechanism:** This form of conflict primarily challenges the cognitive system's ability to select a task-relevant processing pathway and inhibit a competing, often more automatic, pathway for a single, integrated percept.

#### 2. Between-Object Conflict

*   **Definition:** Conflict arises from the relationship between **spatially separate objects**â€”a target and one or more distractors. The attributes are spatially "unstacked."
*   **Canonical Example:** The [[Canonical Tasks/Flanker Task]]. The central target letter (e.g., 'H') and the surrounding flanker letters (e.g., 'S') are distinct objects.
*   **Cognitive Mechanism:** This form of conflict primarily challenges the efficacy of **selective spatial attention**. The core task for the cognitive system is to narrow its attentional window or "zoom lens" to focus on the target's location while actively filtering out information from the surrounding distractors.

### Implications for the Parametric Design Space & Thesis Discussion

This distinction offers a powerful lens through which to interpret the [[Results/PCA Results]]. The PCA, in its effort to find the largest axes of variance across the entire space, may place Stroop and Flanker paradigms in close proximity because they share the high-level feature of S-S conflict.

In the **Discussion Chapter**, this note should be used to argue the following:

1.  **Acknowledge the Abstraction:** State that while the PCA correctly identifies a general "S-S Conflict" dimension, this is a necessary simplification that abstracts over a key structural difference in how that conflict is instantiated.
2.  **Propose a Finer-Grained Structure:** Argue that a more complete model of the design space would include a sub-dimension, perhaps a continuous parameter of "Spatial Integration" or "Attribute Colocation," that runs from maximally separated (Flanker) to maximally integrated (Stroop).
3.  **Connect to Future Research:** This distinction highlights a potential "gap" in the literature that the parametric approach can address. One could design novel paradigms that parametrically vary the spatial distance between formerly integrated attributes to trace the transition from within-object to between-object conflict.

This nuance is a key sign of sophisticated analysis. It shows an understanding of not just the structure revealed by the analysis, but also the inherent limitations of that analysis and the deeper theoretical questions that remain.
