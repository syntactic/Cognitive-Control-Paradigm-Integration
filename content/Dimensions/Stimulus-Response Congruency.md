**Stimulus-Response (S-R) Congruency** captures conflict from direct, automatic mapping between an irrelevant stimulus attribute (typically spatial) and a physical motor response feature. The irrelevant attribute bypasses semantic interpretation and directly primes motor actions. This is quintessential [[Canonical Tasks/Simon Task|Simon-like]] conflict.

**Theoretical Basis:** Direct operationalization of "Type 3" ensembles from [[Kornblum et al. (1990)]]'s Dimensional Overlap Model, generalized to non-spatial structural correspondences.

### Paradigm Examples
*   **[[Canonical Tasks/Simon Task|Simon]]:** Stimulus location vs. response location
*   **[[Canonical Tasks/Stroop Task|Stroop]]/[[Canonical Tasks/Flanker Task|Flanker]]:** Not present in classic centered versions; can be added via lateral presentation ([[Egner et al. (2007)]])

### Non-Spatial Examples
*   **Pitch-Height:** High/low pitch primes upward/downward responses
*   **Affective:** Positive/negative valence primes approach/avoidance actions  
*   **Magnitude-Force:** Large/small numbers prime forceful/soft keypresses

### Values
*   **`Congruent`**: Irrelevant attribute corresponds to required response location
*   **`Incongruent`**: Irrelevant attribute conflicts with required response location
*   **`Neutral`**: Stimulus location is non-lateralized (e.g., center presentation)
*   **`N/A`**: No irrelevant spatial dimension or spatially coded response

### Distinction from Other Dimensions
*   **Orthogonal to S-S Congruency:** `S-R Congruency` is about stimulus location vs. response location. `[[Dimensions/Stimulus-Stimulus Congruency|S-S Congruency]]` is about two semantic features of a stimulus.
*   **CRITICAL: Distinct from SRM:** These two dimensions are orthogonal and must not be confused.
    *   `[[Dimensions/Stimulus Response Mapping|Stimulus Response Mapping (SRM)]]` refers to the **instructed, intentional rule** for the **relevant** stimulus feature (e.g., the rule "respond *away from* the tone").
    *   `S-R Congruency` refers to the **automatic, incidental priming** from an **irrelevant** stimulus feature (e.g., an irrelevant light flashes on the same side as the required response key).
    *   You can have a `Compatible` SRM with an `Incongruent` S-R trial, and vice versa.

### Super Experiment Mapping
One pathway (`mov`) represents relevant task feature; another (`or`) represents irrelevant spatial location. S-R Congruency depends on whether automatically primed response matches correct response from `mov` pathway.
