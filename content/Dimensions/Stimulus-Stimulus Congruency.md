**Stimulus-Stimulus (S-S) Congruency** captures conflict between stimulus attributes or afforded operations that prime competing responses. This includes both attribute-based conflict (Stroop word vs. ink color) and operation-based bivalence (single stimulus affording multiple task operations).

**Theoretical Basis:** Direct operationalization of "Type 4" ensembles from [[Kornblum et al. (1990)]]'s Dimensional Overlap Model, generalized to include operation-based bivalence.

### Paradigm Examples
*   **[[Canonical Tasks/Stroop Task|Stroop]]:** Word meaning vs. ink color
*   **[[Canonical Tasks/Flanker Task|Flanker]]:** Flanker identity vs. target identity  
*   **[[Canonical Tasks/Simon Task|Simon]]:** Not present - stimulus lacks conflicting semantic attributes

### Values
*   **`Congruent`**: Irrelevant attribute primes same response as relevant attribute
*   **`Incongruent`**: Irrelevant attribute primes different response  
*   **`Neutral`**: Bivalent stimulus where irrelevant attribute doesn't map to relevant response set
*   **`N/A`**: Functionally univalent stimulus lacking response-relevant second attribute

### Distinction from Other Dimensions
*   **Orthogonal to S-R Congruency:** S-S Congruency is about the relationship *between two stimulus features*. [[Dimensions/Stimulus-Response Congruency|S-R Congruency]] is about the relationship *between an irrelevant stimulus location and the response location*. A paradigm can have one, the other, both, or neither, as demonstrated by [[Egner et al. (2007)]].
*   **Distinct from SRM:** `S-S Congruency` describes conflict from an *irrelevant* feature, while `[[Dimensions/Stimulus Response Mapping]]` describes the nature of the *instructed rule* for the *relevant* feature.

### Super Experiment Mapping
Bivalent stimulus activating both `mov` and `or` pathways with SOA=0:
*   **Congruent:** Both pathways map to same response key
*   **Incongruent:** Pathways map to different response keys  
*   **Neutral:** Distractor pathway doesn't map to active response set

### Key Literature
*   [[Stroop (1935)]]
*   [[Eriksen & Eriksen (1974)]]
*   [[Egner et al. (2007)]]
