Definition: The number of distinct stimulus-response (S-R) episodes that the participant is instructed to complete **within a single trial presentation** or very close temporal proximity, typically triggered by temporally distinct stimuli (S1, S2).

**Values:** Typically **Categorical {1, 2}**.

**Relevance to Design Space:**

- A fundamental dimension differentiating paradigm classes:
    
    - **Number of Tasks = 1:** Encompasses [[Single Task]] paradigms (with or without distractors) and [[Task Switching]] paradigms (where each trial involves one S-R episode, but the task rule switches between trials).
    - **Number of Tasks = 2:** Encompasses [[Dual-Task Performance & PRP|Dual Task]] and [[Dual-Task Performance & PRP|PRP]] paradigms, where two distinct S-R episodes are required within the trial.
- The value of Number of Tasks determines the applicability of other dimensions like [[Inter-task SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)]].

Super Exp. Mapping: Setting Super Experiment parameters for only Task 1 vs. parameters for both Task 1 and Task 2 to define required S-R episodes within a trial.
