**Preparation** refers to proactive cognitive processes that configure the system in advance of an expected task or stimulus. This proactive component of [[Cognitive Control]] contrasts with reactive processes triggered by the stimulus itself.

**Operationalization:** Studied by manipulating available preparation time:
*   **[[Dimensions/CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]]:** Time between task cue and stimulus
*   **[[Dimensions/RSI (Response Stimulus Interval)|RSI]]:** Time between response and next stimulus in predictable sequences

**Mechanisms:** Encompasses multiple processes collectively termed [[Theoretical Concepts/Task-Set Reconfiguration|Task-Set Reconfiguration]]:
*   Goal updating and rule activation
*   Attentional biasing toward task-relevant features
*   Inhibition of prior task-set to prevent [[Theoretical Concepts/Task-Set Inertia|proactive interference]]

**Evidence:** Performance costs reduce with increased preparation time:
*   [[Meiran (1996)]]: [[Effects/Switch Cost|Switch Costs]] reduced with long vs. short CSI
*   [[Rubin & Meiran (2005)]]: [[Effects/Mixing Cost|Mixing Costs]] from [[Dimensions/Stimulus-Stimulus Congruency|S-S conflict]] larger at short CSI

**Relevance:** Central [[Cognitive Control]] mechanism. [[Parametric Design Space]] uses [[Dimensions/CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]] and [[Dimensions/RSI (Response Stimulus Interval)|RSI]] to quantify proactive control and dissociate preparatory vs. stimulus-driven components.
