###### Definition
**Preparation**, in the context of cognitive control, refers to the set of proactive, goal-directed cognitive processes that configure the information processing system in advance of an expected task or stimulus. This allows for more efficient handling of the upcoming event, especially in complex or conflicting situations like [[Task Switching]].

It represents the *proactive* component of [[Cognitive Control]], distinct from *reactive* control processes that are triggered by the stimulus itself.

###### Operationalization: How Preparation is Studied
The primary experimental method for studying advance preparation is the systematic manipulation of the time available for it. This is most commonly achieved by varying:

*   **[[Dimensions/CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|Cue-Stimulus Interval (CSI)]]:** The time between an explicit task cue and the imperative stimulus. A longer CSI provides more time for preparation.
*   **[[Dimensions/RSI (Response Stimulus Interval)|Response-Stimulus Interval (RSI)]]:** In paradigms with predictable task sequences (e.g., AABB), the time between the previous response and the next stimulus also serves as a preparation interval.

###### Functional Role & Mechanisms
Preparation is not a single process but likely encompasses several activities that are often collectively referred to as **[[Theoretical Concepts/Task-Set Reconfiguration|Task-Set Reconfiguration]]**. These may include:

*   **Goal Updating:** Retrieving and activating the goal and parameters for the upcoming task.
*   **Rule Activation:** Loading the relevant S-R mapping rules into an active state.
*   **Attentional Biasing:** Prioritizing the processing of task-relevant stimulus features.
*   **Inhibition of Prior Task-Set:** Suppressing the rules and S-R mappings of the task that was just performed to prevent [[Theoretical Concepts/Task-Set Inertia|proactive interference]].

###### Key Behavioral Evidence
The most robust evidence for preparation comes from the reduction of performance costs (like [[Effects/Switch Cost]]) with increased preparation time.

*   **[[Meiran (1996)]]** used an explicit task-cuing paradigm with a variable CSI. The key finding was that [[Effects/Switch Cost|Switch Costs]] were significantly reduced at a long CSI (~1400-1700ms) compared to a short CSI (~200ms). This provides strong evidence for a time-consuming [[Theoretical Concepts/Task-Set Reconfiguration|reconfiguration]] process that can be completed (at least partially) in advance of the stimulus.

*   Similarly, **[[Rubin & Meiran (2005)]]** used a variable CSI (100ms vs. 1000ms) to investigate [[Effects/Mixing Cost|Mixing Costs]]. They found that the mixing cost associated with stimuli that are bivalent due to [[Dimensions/Stimulus-Stimulus Congruency|S-S conflict]] was much larger at the short CSI. This demonstrates that advance preparation is not only critical for switching tasks but also for managing stimulus-driven interference in a mixed-task context.

###### Relevance to Thesis
Preparation is a central mechanism in [[Cognitive Control]]. The [[Parametric Design Space]] uses [[Dimensions/CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]] and [[Dimensions/RSI (Response Stimulus Interval)|RSI]] as primary axes to quantify the degree to which a paradigm allows for or investigates proactive control. The ability to parametrically vary preparation time is a powerful tool for dissociating proactive (preparatory) and reactive (stimulus-driven) components of task control.
