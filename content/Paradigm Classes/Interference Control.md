Refers to the ability to focus on task-relevant information and suppress or ignore irrelevant information that could impede performance. Studied using paradigms where irrelevant stimulus features conflict with relevant ones.

**Key Paradigms:**

- **Stroop Task:** Naming ink color while ignoring color word. Tests interference from highly automated process (reading). See [[Stroop (1935)]], [[Cohen et al. (1990)]].
- **Flanker Task:** Responding to a central target while ignoring surrounding conflicting flankers.
- **Simon Task:** Responding to a non-spatial feature while ignoring conflicting spatial location.

**Key Concepts/Effects:**

- **Congruency Effect:** RT/Accuracy difference between incongruent and congruent/neutral trials.
- [[Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]]: The dimension defining the conflict.
- [[Response Set Overlap]]: Can determine if conflict occurs at stimulus or response level.
- **Conflict Monitoring/Adaptation:** Mechanisms that detect conflict and adjust control accordingly, as described by [[Theoretical Concepts/Conflict Monitoring Theory]] (e.g., [[Congruency Sequence Effect (CSE)]]).

**Relation to other concepts:**

- Relevant in [[Dual-Task Performance & PRP|Dual Task]] when tasks might interfere.
- Relevant in [[Task Switching]] when stimuli are [[Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|bivalent]].
- Probes selective [[Attention]].
