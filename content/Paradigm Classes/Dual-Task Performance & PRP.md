Refers to experimental situations where participants perform **two distinct tasks (T1 and T2)** requiring responses within close temporal proximity ([[Number of Tasks]]=2, [[Task 2 Response Probability]]=1).

**Psychological Refractory Period (PRP):**

- The canonical paradigm within this category.
- Manipulates the [[Inter-task SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)]] between S1 and S2.
- Key finding: [[PRP Effect]] - RT2 increases as SOA decreases (often with slope ~ -1 at short SOA). RT1 is often assumed stable but can show [[Dual-Task Cost]].
- Often interpreted via [[Bottleneck Theories]] (e.g., [[Response Selection Bottleneck (RSB)]]) or strategic scheduling ([[EPIC-SRD]]).

**Other Variants:**

- Full Dual-Task (SOA=0).
- Studies may vary task difficulty, stimulus/response modalities (influencing [[Response Set Overlap]]).

**Relation to other concepts:**

- Transitions to [[Task Switching]] at long SOA.
- Can be combined with [[Preparation and Pre-cuing|Pre-cuing]] (varying [[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)]] before S1 or S2).

**Key Literature:**

- [[Pashler (1994)]] (Review, RSB)
- [[Meyer & Kieras (1997a)]] (EPIC/SRD)
- [[Telford (1931)]] (Early PRP-like findings)
- [[Koch et al. (2018)]] (Review)

**Relationship to Other Executive Functions**

The ability to coordinate two tasks may rely on a distinct set of executive processes. The foundational work of [[Miyake et al. (2000)]] found that while performance on tasks like WCST and Stroop could be predicted by latent factors of Shifting and Inhibition, performance on a dual-task paradigm was not significantly predicted by any of their three core factors. This suggests that dual-task coordination might be a separate executive function, distinct from those involved in task switching or simple interference resolution.
