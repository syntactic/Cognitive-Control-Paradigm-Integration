###### Definition
**Task-Set Reconfiguration** is a theoretical account proposing that the [[Effects/Switch Cost|Switch Cost]] reflects the duration of an active, endogenous, and time-consuming **control process** required to change the cognitive system's settings from one task to another.

This is a "top-down" view of task switching, where the cost arises from the executive act of disengaging the previous task-set and engaging the new one. This process involves updating goals, retrieving S-R rules, and biasing attentional and response systems to suit the upcoming task.

###### Key Proponents & Evidence
*   This view is most strongly associated with **[[Rogers & Monsell (1995)]]** and **[[Meiran (1996)]]**.
*   The primary evidence for reconfiguration comes from experiments showing that **switch costs are systematically reduced when participants are given more preparation time**.
    *   **[[Rogers & Monsell (1995)]]** showed this using predictable alternating runs and a variable [[Dimensions/RSI (Response Stimulus Interval)|RSI]].
    *   **[[Meiran (1996)]]** provided even cleaner evidence using an explicit task-cuing paradigm with a variable [[Dimensions/CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]], demonstrating that the cost reduction was tied to the cue-stimulus interval, not just the passage of time.

###### Role in Explaining Key Phenomena
*   **Reducible Switch Cost:** The reconfiguration account directly explains the portion of the switch cost that can be eliminated with preparation. This is considered the "endogenous" or "preparatory" component of the cost.
*   **Residual Switch Cost:** The standard reconfiguration model has more difficulty explaining the [[Residual Switch Cost]] that remains after long preparation. This has led to several hypotheses:
    1.  The reconfiguration process is not purely endogenous and requires the arrival of the stimulus to be completed (a "stimulus-triggered" component).
    2.  The residual cost is not due to reconfiguration at all, but rather to a separate mechanism, such as **[[Theoretical Concepts/Task-Set Inertia|Task-Set Inertia]]**.
    3.  Another major explanation, the Failure-to-Engage hypothesis ([[De Jong (2000)]]), posits that the residual cost is strategic, arising from trials where no preparation is attempted.

###### Contrast with Task-Set Inertia
Task-Set Reconfiguration emphasizes the active, preparatory control processes needed to prepare for the *upcoming* task. This contrasts with the **[[Theoretical Concepts/Task-Set Inertia|Task-Set Inertia]]** account, which emphasizes the passive, carry-over interference from the *previous* task. Most modern theories acknowledge that both mechanisms likely contribute to overall task-switching performance.
