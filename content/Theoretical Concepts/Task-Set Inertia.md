**Task-Set Inertia (TSI)** proposes that [[Effects/Switch Cost|Switch Cost]] arises from proactive interference when the previous task-set's activation persists and must be overcome. The old task-set doesn't vanish but creates inertial bias requiring time and effort to resolve.

**Key Evidence:** [[Allport el al. (1994)|Allport et al. 1994]] showed switch costs were insensitive to preparation time, suggesting costs are incurred reactively after stimulus appearance rather than through advance reconfiguration.

###### Role in Explaining Key Phenomena
*   **Residual Switch Cost:** TSI provides a natural explanation for the [[Residual Switch Cost]]â€”the portion of the switch cost that remains even with very long preparation intervals. The theory posits that this is because the interference from the old task-set cannot be fully resolved until the new stimulus arrives and forces the conflict to be dealt with reactively.
*   **Asymmetrical Switch Costs:** TSI can also explain why it is sometimes harder to switch to a stronger, more dominant task. The idea is that more control is required to perform a weaker task, leading to a more strongly activated (and thus more inert) task-set. This highly active "weak" task-set then causes greater proactive interference when switching back to the "strong" task. ([[Yeung & Monsell (2003)]])

###### Contrast with Task-Set Reconfiguration
TSI is often framed as a "passive" or "bottom-up" interference account, contrasting directly with the "active" or "top-down" control account of **[[Theoretical Concepts/Task-Set Reconfiguration|Task-Set Reconfiguration]]**. While modern views see both processes as likely contributors, the TSI hypothesis emphasizes the persistence of the past, whereas the reconfiguration hypothesis emphasizes preparation for the future.
