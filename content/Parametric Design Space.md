The core idea of this thesis is to conceptualize standard cognitive control paradigms not as discrete categories, but as regions within a multi-dimensional space defined by underlying experimental parameters.

**Key Goals:**

1. Identify the relevant [[Derived Dimensions vs. Low-Level Parameters|derived dimensions]] based on literature.
2. Map existing empirical studies onto this space using their parameter settings.
3. Analyze the structure of this space (potentially using [[PCA]]) based on parameters definable within the [[Super Experiment Framework]].
4. Identify [[Transitions and Modulators]].
5. Identify gaps (unexplored regions) and limitations (dimensions outside the framework).

This approach builds on early theoretical work, such as the "Dimensional Overlap" model by [[Kornblum et al. (1990)]], who developed a foundational taxonomy of stimulus-response compatibility tasks. Their work demonstrated that paradigms like the Stroop and Simon tasks could be seen as variants within a common conceptual framework, providing a direct precedent for this thesis's more comprehensive mapping effort. It is also conceptually parallel to the work of [[Miyake et al. (2000)]], who used latent variable analysis to decompose complex executive tasks into more fundamental, separable abilities, similarly aiming to bring a unified structure to the field.

**Dimensions Tentatively Identified:**

- [[Number of Tasks]]
- [[Inter-task SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)]]
- [[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)]]
- [[Switch Cost]]
- [[Dimensions/Stimulus-Stimulus Congruency]]
- [[Dimensions/Stimulus-Response Congruency]]
- [[Response Set Overlap]]
- [[Task Cue Type]]
- (Initially considered, likely excluded) Cue Validity
