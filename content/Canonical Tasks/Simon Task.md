###### Core Concept: The Simon Task & Effect

The **Simon Task** is an experimental paradigm designed to investigate **stimulus-response (S-R) compatibility effects**, specifically how an irrelevant spatial feature of a stimulus can interfere with or facilitate a response to a non-spatial feature of that same stimulus. The robust finding from this task is known as the **Simon Effect**.

The **Simon Effect** refers to the observation that reaction times (RTs) are typically faster and error rates lower when the spatial location of a stimulus corresponds to the spatial location of the required response, even if the stimulus location is entirely irrelevant to the task. Conversely, performance is impaired when stimulus location and response location are incongruent.

###### Typical Paradigm Structure (Classic Version, e.g., [[Simon & Rudell (1967)]])

1.  **Task Goal:** Participants are instructed to respond to a *non-spatial feature* of a stimulus (e.g., its color, shape, the meaning of a word).
2.  **Stimuli:** These stimuli are presented at varying *spatial locations* (e.g., left or right of a central fixation point, or to the left or right ear for auditory stimuli).
3.  **Irrelevant Spatial Dimension:** The spatial location of the stimulus is made explicitly irrelevant to determining the correct response.
4.  **Responses:** Responses are typically spatially defined (e.g., a left-hand keypress vs. a right-hand keypress).

###### Key Conditions & How Congruency Arises:

*   **Relevant Dimension:** The feature participants must respond to (e.g., respond "blue" to blue stimuli, "red" to red stimuli).
*   **Irrelevant Dimension:** The spatial location of the stimulus.
*   **[[Dimensions/Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]]:**
    *   **Congruent Trials:** The irrelevant spatial location of the stimulus matches the spatial location of the correct response defined by the relevant feature.
        *   *Example:* Task is "press left key for BLUE stimulus." A blue square appears on the *left* side of the screen. The irrelevant location (left) matches the required response location (left key).
    *   **Incongruent Trials:** The irrelevant spatial location of the stimulus conflicts with the spatial location of the correct response.
        *   *Example:* Task is "press left key for BLUE stimulus." A blue square appears on the *right* side of the screen. The irrelevant location (right) mismatches the required response location (left key).
*   **[[Dimensions/Stimulus Response Mapping|Stimulus Response Mapping]]:** In the classic Simon task, the mapping between the *relevant feature* and the response is typically `Arbitrary` or `Compatible` (e.g., word "left" maps to left key). The conflict arises from the *irrelevant spatial feature*.

###### Variations and Underlying Mechanisms (e.g., [[Simon (1969)|Simon 1969]])

*   Studies like [[Simon (1969)|Simon 1969]] ("Reactions Toward the Source of Stimulation") have shown that the Simon effect likely stems from a **"natural" or prepotent tendency to respond spatially toward the source of any stimulation.**
*   In Simon (1969), the stimulus location *was* relevant, but the S-R mapping rule was manipulated:
    *   **Compatible SRM ("Toward"):** Respond toward the stimulus location (e.g., tone in left ear -> respond left).
    *   **Incompatible SRM ("Away"):** Respond away from the stimulus location (e.g., tone in left ear -> respond right).
*   The cost observed in the Incompatible SRM condition (slower RTs) demonstrates the strength of this underlying spatial S-R compatibility and the effort needed to override it. This cost is thought to be the same source of interference seen in the classic Simon effect where the spatial dimension is irrelevant.

###### Theoretical Interpretations:

*   **Dimensional Overlap Model:** In the framework of [[Kornblum et al. (1990)]], the Simon task is a classic "Type 3" ensemble, where the relevant stimulus dimension (e.g., color) has no overlap with the spatial response set, but the irrelevant stimulus dimension (location) does, causing automatic response activation and interference.
*   **Automatic Response Activation:** The irrelevant spatial location of the stimulus automatically activates a spatially corresponding response code.
*   **Dual-Route Models / Response Competition:** Information about the relevant feature and the irrelevant spatial location are processed (perhaps in parallel). If the responses primed by these two routes conflict, response selection is delayed due to competition.
*   **Attentional Shift / Orienting:** The stimulus location might automatically capture attention or trigger an orienting response towards its location, biasing response selection.

###### Relevance to Cognitive Control:

*   Demonstrates the limits of selective attention and the difficulty in completely ignoring salient but task-irrelevant information.
*   Highlights automatic processing tendencies (spatial S-R links) that must be managed or inhibited by cognitive control mechanisms to ensure goal-directed behavior.
*   Used to study conflict monitoring and resolution.

###### Key Parameters for Design Space Mapping:

*   [[Number of Tasks|Number of Tasks]]: Typically 1.
*   [[Dimensions/Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]]: Crucial for defining congruent/incongruent trials in the classic Simon effect.
*   [[Dimensions/Stimulus Response Mapping|Stimulus Response Mapping]]: Becomes the central manipulation in variants like Simon (1969).
*   Stimulus Modality (visual, auditory).
*   Response Modality (manual, vocal).
*   [[Distractor SOA]]: Typically 0 (or N/A) as relevant and irrelevant features are part of one stimulus event.
*   [[Dimensions/CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]]: Typically 0.
*   [[Dimensions/Switch Rate|Switch Rate]]: Typically 0%.

The Simon Task is a powerful tool for investigating the interplay between automatic spatial processing and controlled, task-directed responding.
