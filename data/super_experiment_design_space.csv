Top row presented 100ms before bottom. This is actually a pretty unique case in the literature review in that it decomposed attributes of the target stimulus over time. This definitely can't be handled by the super experiment and we don't have a way of coding this in our higher level dimensions. Right now SOA as a dimension is overloaded to represent the timing offset of a distractor (top word in this case) with respect to the timing of the target stimulus. Because the target stimulus is decomposed into two halves, that means that the distractor is simultaneous with the first component but precedes the second component by 100ms. I marked this as bivalent because the top stimulus object is indeed bivalent. Congruent condition was slower than neutral. RT=800ms.",
