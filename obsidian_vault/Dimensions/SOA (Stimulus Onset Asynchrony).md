#dimension

Definition: The time interval between the onset of the stimulus for Task 1 (S1) and the onset of the stimulus for Task 2 (S2) in dual-task paradigms.

Relevance: The primary independent variable in [[Dual-Task Performance & PRP|PRP]] studies.

- Short SOA: High temporal overlap, leads to maximal [[PRP Effect]].
- Long SOA: Low/No temporal overlap, RT2 approaches single-task baseline. Transitions towards [[Task Switching]] regime.
- SOA = 0: Full dual-task, simultaneous onset.
- Negative SOA: S2 precedes S1.
