The Backward Crosstalk Effect (BCE) refers to the finding in [[Dual-Task Performance & PRP|PRP]] or other dual-task paradigms that properties related to the processing of the second task (Task 2), particularly its stimulus-response (S-R) mapping or response selection, can influence the measured reaction time of the first task (RT1).

**Typical Observation:** RT1 is measurably influenced by the S-R compatibility relationship between the Task 1 response and the Task 2 response, even though the Task 2 stimulus appears later and the Task 2 response is executed later. For example, RT1 might be slightly faster if the (upcoming) Task 2 requires the same response action/location as Task 1, and slower if it requires a conflicting one.

**Mechanism Explanation:**  
BCE is taken as strong evidence against strictly serial processing across all stages. It suggests that some processing for Task 2, particularly [[Response Selection Bottleneck (RSB)|response selection]] or activation of response codes, can occur in parallel with the later stages (e.g., motor execution) of Task 1. The concurrently activated Task 2 response code can then interfere with (or facilitate) the completion or measurement of the Task 1 response via [[Crosstalk]].

**Theoretical Significance:**

- Directly challenges simple [[Bottleneck Theories|Response Selection Bottleneck (RSB)]] models that assume Task 2 central processing cannot begin until Task 1 central processing is fully complete.
- Supports models allowing for some degree of parallel central processing or interaction between Task 1 execution and Task 2 central stages (e.g., some capacity sharing models, cascaded models, or models where bottlenecks are not absolute).
- Highlights the complex interplay and potential for interference even when tasks are nominally ordered.

**Relation to other concepts:**

- It is a specific instance of [[Crosstalk]].
- Distinguished from [[N-2 Repetition Cost]], which is a between-trial effect in [[Task Switching]].
