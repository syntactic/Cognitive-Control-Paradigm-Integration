Definition: A performance decrement (typically slower reaction times and/or increased error rates) observed when participants switch from performing one task to performing a different task, compared to when they repeat the same task.

**Calculation:** Switch Cost = RT_switch_trial - RT_repeat_trial

**Key Characteristics:**

- Robust finding in [[Task Switching]] paradigms.
- Can be reduced by providing preparation time ([[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)]]) or predictable task sequences.
- A [[Residual Switch Cost]] often remains even with long preparation.
- Can be asymmetric, depending on the relative strength/practice of the tasks involved (e.g., [[Yeung & Monsell (2003)]]).

**Theoretical Explanations:**

- **Task-Set Reconfiguration:** The active process of changing the cognitive system's settings to suit the new task (e.g., [[Rogers & Monsell (1995)]]).
- **Task-Set Inertia / Proactive Interference:** Lingering activation of the previous task set interferes with the current one (e.g., [[Allport et al. (1994)]]).
- **Inhibition:** Inhibition of the recently abandoned task set.

**Relevance to Design Space:**

- The primary dependent variable in the [[Task Switching]] paradigm region.
- Its modulation by CSI, [[Switch Cost]], [[Task Cue Type]], etc., reveals aspects of [[Cognitive Control]].
