###### Definition
**Asymmetrical Switch Costs** refer to the phenomenon in [[Task Switching]] where the performance cost of switching between two tasks of unequal strength or familiarity is unequal. The specific pattern of asymmetry depends on the level of between-task interference.

There are two primary patterns observed:

1.  **Larger Cost Switching to the Stronger Task:** In situations with high interference (e.g., overlapping responses), the cost to switch from a weak, non-dominant task to a strong, dominant one is often *larger* than the cost of switching in the other direction. This "paradoxical" finding was famously demonstrated by [[Allport el al. (1994)|Allport et al. 1994]].
2.  **Larger Cost Switching to the Weaker Task:** When interference between tasks is experimentally reduced (e.g., by using disjoint response sets), the asymmetry often reverses. The cost to switch to the weaker, less-practiced task becomes larger, which is more intuitively expected. This reversal was demonstrated by [[Yeung & Monsell (2003)]].

###### Theoretical Importance
The existence and malleability of asymmetrical switch costs provide a powerful test for theories of task switching.
*   The **[[Theoretical Concepts/Task-Set Inertia|Task-Set Inertia]]** account explains the Allport et al. pattern by suggesting that performing the weaker task requires more active control, leading to a more "inert" task-set that causes greater proactive interference on the subsequent switch trial.
*   The reversal of the asymmetry shown by Yeung & Monsell suggests that both task-set inertia (interference from the past) and **[[Theoretical Concepts/Task-Set Reconfiguration|Task-Set Reconfiguration]]** (difficulty preparing for the future) contribute to switch costs, with their relative influence modulated by the degree of between-task crosstalk.
