###### Definition
**Dual-Task Cost** refers to the performance decrement, typically observed as a slowing of reaction time for the first task (RT1), when that task is performed as part of a dual-task pair, compared to when it is performed alone in a single-task block.

`Dual-Task Cost = RT1_dual_task - RT1_single_task`

###### Distinction from PRP Effect
The Dual-Task Cost is distinct from the [[Effects/PRP Effect|PRP Effect]]:
*   **Dual-Task Cost** affects **Task 1**.
*   **PRP Effect** affects **Task 2**.

While the PRP effect is primarily explained by a central processing bottleneck, the Dual-Task Cost is thought to reflect a more general **preparatory limitation**.

###### Theoretical Explanation
The primary explanation for the Dual-Task Cost is that having to maintain and be prepared for two different task-sets simultaneously is inherently more demanding than preparing for just one. This leads to a less-than-optimal state of readiness for T1, resulting in a slower RT1, even at long SOAs where there is no temporal overlap in central processing. This concept is discussed extensively in [[Pashler (1994)]] as the "preparatory limitation" component of dual-task interference.
