Cognitive control refers to the set of mechanisms that allow the brain to flexibly configure information processing and guide thoughts and actions based on current goals, especially in the face of conflict or complexity.

Key functions include:

- Goal maintenance
- Task-set configuration and [[Task Switching]]
- Managing [[Dual-Task Performance & PRP|Dual-Task Interference]]
- [[Interference Control]] (resolving conflict)
- [[Preparation and Pre-cuing|Preparation]] for upcoming events
- Response inhibition

This thesis investigates the relationships between experimental paradigms designed to probe these functions, mapping them within a unified [[Parametric Design Space]].
