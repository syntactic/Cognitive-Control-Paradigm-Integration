The process of mapping the existing literature onto the [[Parametric Design Space]] involves:

1. **Identify Key Studies:** Using literature search (databases, reviews like [[Kiesel et al. (2010)]], citation tracking).
2. **Select Derived Dimensions:** Define the core conceptual dimensions (e.g., [[SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)]], [[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)]], [[N_Tasks]], etc.).
3. **Code Studies:** For each relevant study/condition:
    - Determine its values along the chosen derived dimensions.
    - Represent the study as a point or trajectory on the conceptual map.
    - Record details (citation, specific tasks, key manipulation, key finding) in a structured format (e.g., CSV).
4. **Translate to SE Parameters:** For studies within scope, translate the experimental setup into concrete [[Super Experiment Framework]] low-level parameter values. This forms the dataset for [[PCA]].
5. **Identify Gaps:** Locate regions in the derived dimension space with sparse literature coverage.
6. **Identify SE Limitations:** Note studies whose core manipulation cannot be adequately translated into SE parameters (e.g., complex cue validity).
