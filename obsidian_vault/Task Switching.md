#paradigm

Refers to experimental situations where participants switch between **two or more task rule sets** applied sequentially across trials ([[N_Tasks]]=1 per trial, but multiple task sets active across the block).

**Key Features:**

- **Switch Cost:** RT/Accuracy is worse on switch trials (Task A -> Task B) compared to repeat trials (Task A -> Task A).
- **Mixing Cost:** RT/Accuracy on repeat trials is worse than in single-task blocks.
- **Preparation Effects:** Switch costs are often reduced by providing preparation time ([[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)]]) or predictable sequences.
- **Residual Switch Cost:** Switch costs often remain even with long preparation time.
- **Task-Set Inertia / Priming:** Carry-over activation/interference from the previous task set.
- **Reconfiguration:** Active control process to change the current task set.
- **N-2 Repetition Cost / Backward Inhibition:** Performance cost when returning to a recently abandoned task (e.g., ABA vs CBA).

**Common Manipulations:**

- [[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)]]
- [[Switch Cost]] / Sequence Predictability (Random vs. Predictable Alternating Runs)
- [[Task Cue Type]] (Arbitrary vs. Transparent)
- [[Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]]
- [[Response Set Overlap]]

**Relation to other concepts:**

- Related to [[PRP]] at long SOAs.
- Probes [[Cognitive Control]] flexibility.
