Identifying transition points where manipulating a parameter smoothly changes the nature of the cognitive challenge from one canonical paradigm to another.

- **[[Dual-Task Performance & PRP|PRP]] <-> [[Task Switching]]:** Primarily via increasing [[SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)]]. Focus shifts from bottleneck management to sequential task-set control (inertia/reconfiguration). See [[Pashler (1994)]], [[Kiesel et al. (2010)]].
- **[[Dual-Task Performance & PRP|Dual Task]] <-> [[Single Task]] + Distractor:** Primarily via manipulating Task 2 cue effectiveness (e.g., decreasing dur_cue2). Focus shifts from managing two active tasks to filtering an irrelevant stimulus. See [[Yeung & Monsell (2003)]] for related response set manipulation effects.
- **Effect of [[Preparation and Pre-cuing|Preparation]] (CSI):** Varying [[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)]] modulates costs within paradigms (reduces [[Switch Cost]], may reduce [[PRP Effect]] at short SOA). Links proactive control to online performance limits. See [[Meiran (1996)]].
