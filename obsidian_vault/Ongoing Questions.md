*   **N > 2 Task Pools:** How to best represent experiments with more than two available task sets (e.g., [[Rubin & Meiran (2005)]] Exp2 Conditions: MWC, AMWBC, UMWBC) when SE is structured for two tasks per trial? Should we exclude the experiment?
	* Current solution: ignore conditions with more than two tasks
* **Trial Sequence Format:** Besides switch rate, some studies (e.g., [[Yeung & Monsell (2003)]]) have a predictable task switching format like AABB. We can create trial sequences like that in the Super Experiment, but how should we encode it such that it's compatible with PCA? 
	* Current solution: derive the switch rate from the trial sequence format (AABB then becomes 33% switch rate because there is one switch in three transitions between trials)
