## Study Limitations & SE Framework Constraints

*   **[[Super Experiment Framework|Super Experiment]] Intrinsic Limitations:**
    *   **RSI (Response-Stimulus Interval):** Cannot be directly set as an independent parameter. SE's trial structure is stimulus-onset driven. (e.g., affects mapping [[Rogers & Monsell (1995)]], some [[Stephan & Koch (2010)]] conditions). Map to ITI.
    *   **Cue Validity:** SE doesn't have native inter-trial probabilistic cue validity. Cues are 100% valid for the task they signal within a trial. 
    *   **N > 2 Task Pools:** SE is designed for 2 tasks per trial. Mapping experiments with >2 available task sets (e.g., [[Rubin & Meiran (2005)]] Exp2) requires abstraction to pairwise interactions.
    *   **Specific Stimulus/Task Types:** SE uses generic 'mov'/'or'. Abstraction needed for literature tasks (Stroop, Simon, calculations, line judgments). Fidelity of mapping complex cognitive operations is limited.
    *   **Complex Response Modalities:** SE is keypress-based. Literature with vocal responses requires abstraction.

*   **Mapping & Coding Limitations:**
    *   **Literature Scope:** Cannot be exhaustive; selection bias possible.
    *   **Stimulus Response Mapping:** If there are two tasks, it assumes the mapping type is the same for both tasks. So it is impossible to have one arbitrary mapping for one task and one compatible mapping for another.
    *  **Overloading of the SOA Parameter:** The [[SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)|SOA]] dimension is overloaded, representing two different experimental manipulations based on context. For single-task paradigms (N_Tasks=1) with bivalent stimuli, SOA represents the intra-task asynchrony between target and distractor features. For dual-task paradigms (N_Tasks=2), SOA represents the inter-task asynchrony between the stimuli for T1 and T2. This schema cannot represent paradigms that feature both inter-task and intra-task asynchronies simultaneously, such as a PRP experiment where each of the two tasks is itself an interference task with a non-zero internal SOA. This limitation became apparent when analyzing the structure of [[Allport el al. (1994)|Allport et al. 1994]] Exp. 5, which combines two interference tasks sequentially within a single trial pair.
    *   **Implicit Cues:** Mapping "implicit" cues from literature (e.g., sequence-based) to SE's explicit (though internal) cueing mechanism requires careful interpretation.

*   **Conceptual Limitations:**
    *   Focus on structural/timing parameters; less on learning, strategy, or individual differences beyond what parameters might induce.
