## Study Limitations & SE Framework Constraints

*   **[[Super Experiment Framework|Super Experiment]] Intrinsic Limitations:**
    *   **RSI (Response-Stimulus Interval):** Cannot be directly set as an independent parameter. SE's trial structure is stimulus-onset driven. (e.g., affects mapping [[Rogers & Monsell (1995)]], some [[Stephan & Koch (2010)]] conditions). Map to ITI.
    *   **Cue Validity:** SE doesn't have native inter-trial probabilistic cue validity. Cues are 100% valid for the task they signal within a trial.
    *   **N > 2 Task Pools:** SE is designed for 2 tasks per trial. Mapping experiments with >2 available task sets (e.g., [[Rubin & Meiran (2005)]] Exp2) requires abstraction to pairwise interactions.
    *   **Specific Stimulus/Task Types:** SE uses generic 'mov'/'or'. Abstraction needed for literature tasks (Stroop, Simon, calculations, line judgments). Fidelity of mapping complex cognitive operations is limited.
    *   **Complex Response Modalities:** SE is keypress-based. Literature with vocal responses requires abstraction.

*   **Mapping & Coding Limitations:**
    *   **Literature Scope:** Cannot be exhaustive; selection bias possible.
    *   **Task Difficulty:** Not yet a formal derived dimension; its impact is captured indirectly or in notes.
    *   **Implicit Cues:** Mapping "implicit" cues from literature (e.g., sequence-based) to SE's explicit (though internal) cueing mechanism requires careful interpretation.

*   **Conceptual Limitations:**
    *   Focus on structural/timing parameters; less on learning, strategy, or individual differences beyond what parameters might induce.
