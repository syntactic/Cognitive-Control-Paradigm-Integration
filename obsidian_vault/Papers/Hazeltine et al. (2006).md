**Core Goal:**  
To investigate whether dual-task limitations stem from generic central bottlenecks/capacity limits or from content-dependent interference arising from specific pairings of input (stimulus) and output (response) modalities. Tests if extensive practice can eliminate costs for different modality pairings.

**Paradigms Used:**

- [[Dual-Task Performance & PRP|Dual Task]] paradigm, primarily comparing performance in pure single-task blocks vs. mixed blocks (containing single-task and dual-task trials at [[SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)|SOA]]=0ms).
- Experiment 2b introduced [[SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)|SOA]] manipulation (+/- 50ms) within the dual-task trials after extensive practice.

**Key Manipulations & Comparisons:**

1. **Modality Pairing:** Systematically compared "Standard" pairings (Visual-Manual / Auditory-Vocal) vs. "Non-Standard" pairings (Visual-Vocal / Auditory-Manual) across experiments. This relates to [[Response Set Overlap]] (Disjoint-Modality, but differentiates pairings).
2. **Practice:** Participants underwent extensive training (8 or 16 sessions).
3. **Task Difficulty:** Experiment 3 specifically manipulated auditory task difficulty to equate single-task RTs between a "Hard Standard" pairing group and the "Non-Standard" pairing group from Exp 2a.
4. **SOA:** Experiment 2b introduced SOA manipulation (+/- 50ms) after 16 sessions of practice at SOA=0.

**Key Findings:**

- **Persistent Modality Pairing Effect:** Dual-task costs were consistently and significantly larger (often >2x) for Non-Standard pairings compared to Standard pairings, even after extensive practice (16 sessions / >9000 trials per task).
- **Near Elimination for Standard Pairing:** With Standard pairings, dual-task costs became minimal (though not always zero) after sufficient practice (~8 sessions), replicating Schumacher et al. (2001).
- **Difficulty Dissociation:** Increasing auditory task difficulty (Exp 3) to match single-task RTs with the Non-Standard group did not equate dual-task costs. The Hard Standard group still showed much smaller dual-task costs than the Non-Standard group, indicating costs depend on the pairing, not just overall task difficulty/duration.
- **Mixing Costs:** Present early in practice for both pairings but largely eliminated by ~Session 9, faster than dual-task costs reduced.
- **SOA Effects (Exp 2b):** Manipulating SOA (+/- 50ms) after practice had no significant effect on the residual dual-task costs for the Standard group, and complex/inconsistent effects for the Non-Standard group. This argues against a simple, persistent bottleneck being the primary source of residual costs.
- **Inter-Response Intervals (IRIs):** IRI distributions after practice were inconsistent with a simple bottleneck model (no clear bimodality) but suggested parallel processing with interference for Non-Standard pairings.

**Authors' Main Conclusions/Interpretations:**

- Dual-task interference is **content-dependent**, critically influenced by the specific pairing of input and output modalities.
- Challenges dominant models assuming generic central resources or a content-independent central bottleneck.
- Suggests central interference arises from [[Crosstalk]] or difficulty in coordinating specific S-R pathways, rather than just competition for an abstract processing stage.
- Near-perfect time-sharing is possible but depends crucially on using compatible (Standard) modality pairings.

**Relevance to Thesis:**

- Provides strong empirical evidence for the importance of the modality pairing aspect of the [[Response Set Overlap]] dimension.
- Directly challenges simple [[Bottleneck Theories]] and generic capacity accounts.
- Supports the idea that the "design space" needs to account for content-dependent interactions, not just structural timing.
- Highlights the complex relationship between practice, task difficulty, and specific sources of dual-task interference.
- The dissociation between difficulty (single-task RT) and dual-task cost is a key finding to incorporate.
