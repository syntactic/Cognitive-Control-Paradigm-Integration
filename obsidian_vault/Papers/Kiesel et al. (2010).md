### Core Goal
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the [[Task Switching]] literature, aiming to organize the vast field and promote an integrated understanding of the cognitive control mechanisms involved. The authors structure their review around two primary topics: **task preparation** (cognitive flexibility) and **task interference**. The review serves as a detailed guide to the paradigms, phenomena, and theoretical debates that define modern task-switching research.

### Paradigms Discussed
The review systematically outlines the primary experimental paradigms used to study task switching:
1.  **Mixed-Task Blocks vs. Single-Task Blocks:** The earliest method, used to identify global [[Effects/Mixing Cost|Mixing Costs]].
2.  **Predictable Task Switching (Alternating Runs):** Introduced by [[Rogers & Monsell (1995)]], this paradigm (e.g., AABB sequence) allows for the study of preparation effects by manipulating the [[Dimensions/RSI (Response Stimulus Interval)|RSI]].
3.  **Task-Cuing Paradigm:** Introduced by [[Meiran (1996)]], this uses explicit cues on each trial to indicate the upcoming task, allowing for the manipulation of the [[Dimensions/CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]] to study advance preparation.
4.  **Intermittent Instructions:** A hybrid paradigm where tasks are performed in short runs, with occasional cues indicating a potential switch.
5.  **Voluntary Task Selection:** Paradigms where participants choose which task to perform on a given trial.

### Key Concepts & Phenomena Covered

The paper provides a thorough discussion of the core concepts and effects in the task-switching literature:

*   **Preparatory Control & Task-Set Reconfiguration:**
    *   The reduction of [[Effects/Switch Cost|Switch Costs]] with increased preparation time ([[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]] or [[Dimensions/RSI (Response Stimulus Interval)|RSI]]) is presented as strong evidence for an active, time-consuming **advance reconfiguration** process.
    *   The consistent finding of a **[[Residual Switch Cost]]**, which remains even with long preparation, is a central phenomenon that theories must explain.
    *   Discusses the debate between **gradual preparation** and **all-or-none preparation** models (e.g., De Jong's failure-to-engage hypothesis).
    *   Examines whether preparation is switch-specific or also occurs on repetition trials.

*   **Interference Phenomena:**
    *   **Proactive Interference & [[Task-Set Inertia]]:** Discusses the idea that switch costs arise from the passive carry-over of activation from the previous task set, which must be overcome (e.g., [[Allport et al. (1994)]]).
    *   **Asymmetrical Switch Costs:** Reviews the finding that it can be harder to switch to a stronger/dominant task than a weaker one, often attributed to the need to inhibit the stronger task more forcefully.
    *   **Task Inhibition & N-2 Repetition Costs:** Discusses evidence for inhibitory mechanisms from paradigms using three or more tasks, where performance is worse when returning to a recently abandoned task (e.g., ABA sequence vs. CBA).
    *   **Stimulus-Based Interference:** Emphasizes the role of [[Dimensions/Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|bivalent stimuli]] in creating interference at both the task-set level and the response level (congruency effects).
    *   **Response-Based Interference:** Reviews the impact of [[Dimensions/Response Set Overlap|response-set overlap]] (e.g., bivalent vs. univalent responses) and response-repetition effects on task-switching performance.

### Authors' Main Conclusions
*   Task switching is not a unitary process. The observed performance costs ([[Effects/Switch Cost]], [[Effects/Mixing Cost]]) arise from a combination of factors, including both active control processes (reconfiguration) and more passive interference effects (task-set inertia, stimulus/response conflict).
*   The field has evolved from simple demonstrations of switch costs to sophisticated paradigms that can dissociate different underlying components (e.g., preparation vs. decay, cue-switch vs. task-switch).
*   The paper advocates for integrating task-switching research with broader theories of cognitive control, memory, and associative learning.

### Relevance to Thesis & Mapping Notes
This paper is a cornerstone resource for this thesis project for several reasons:

*   **Foundational Review:** It provides the theoretical and methodological backbone for the entire [[Task Switching]] portion of the [[Parametric Design Space]]. Its structure and the phenomena it describes directly inform the conceptual map.
*   **Defines Key Dimensions & Phenomena:** The review offers clear definitions and discussions of nearly all the core concepts and [[Derived Dimensions vs. Low-Level Parameters|derived dimensions]] used in this thesis, including:
    *   [[Effects/Switch Cost]], [[Effects/Mixing Cost]], and [[Effects/N-2 Repetition Cost|N-2 Repetition Cost]].
    *   The roles of [[Dimensions/CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]] and [[Dimensions/RSI (Response Stimulus Interval)|RSI]].
    *   The importance of [[Dimensions/Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]].
    *   The impact of [[Dimensions/Response Set Overlap|Response Set Overlap]].
    *   The influence of [[Dimensions/Task Cue Type|Task Cue Type]] (e.g., transparent vs. arbitrary cues).
*   **Frames Theoretical Debates:** It clearly outlines the central theoretical tensions in the field (e.g., active reconfiguration vs. passive task-set inertia), which the [[Parametric Design Space|parametric design space]] aims to contextualize.
*   **Excellent Literature Source:** Its extensive bibliography is an invaluable resource for identifying the primary empirical studies ([[Rogers & Monsell (1995)]], [[Meiran (1996)]], [[Allport et al. (1994)]], etc.) that need to be coded and mapped into the `super_experiment_design_space.csv`.
