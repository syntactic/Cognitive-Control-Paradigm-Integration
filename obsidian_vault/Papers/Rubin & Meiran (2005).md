**Full Title:** On the Origins of the Task Mixing Cost in the Cuing Task-Switching Paradigm
**Authors:** Orit Rubin, Nachshon Meiran
**Year:** 2005
**Journal:** Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition

**Core Goal:**  
To investigate the origins of the [[Effects/Mixing Cost|Mixing Cost (MC)]] in cued [[Task Switching]] paradigms. Specifically, the paper tests two hypotheses:
1.  **Task Ambiguity Hypothesis:** MC arises from the need to resolve task ambiguity when stimuli are [[Dimensions/Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|bivalent]] (i.e., afford responses for multiple tasks) in mixed-task blocks.
2.  **Working Memory (WM) Load Hypothesis:** MC arises from the increased load of holding multiple task sets in working memory in mixed-task blocks.

**Paradigm(s) Used:**
Cued [[Task Switching]] paradigm.
-   **Tasks:** Color discrimination vs. Shape discrimination. Stimuli were colored shapes.
-   [[Dimensions/N_Tasks|N_Tasks=1]] per trial.
-   [[Dimensions/Task Cue Type|Task Cue Type]]: Explicit instructional word cues ("color" or "shape").
-   [[Dimensions/CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]]: Varied randomly (100ms or 1000ms).
-   [[Dimensions/Switch Rate|Switch Rate]]: Random task sequencing within mixed blocks (implies 50% switch rate).
-   **Design:** "Sandwich-like" design (Single-task block 1 -> Single-task block 2 -> Mixed-tasks block -> Single-task block 2 (reversed) -> Single-task block 1 (reversed)). This was to control for practice effects.

**Key Manipulations & Comparisons:**

**Experiment 1: Task Ambiguity**
Compared three groups based on stimulus characteristics:
1.  **Univalent (Uni) without filtering:** Irrelevant dimension fixed (e.g., for shape task, all stimuli green). No ambiguity, no filtering needed.
2.  **Univalent plus Filtering (Uni+F):** Irrelevant dimension varied but with values not used in the competing task (e.g., for shape task, stimuli green or yellow; color task used red/blue). No ambiguity, but filtering of irrelevant variation needed.
3.  **Bivalent plus Filtering (Biv+F):** Irrelevant dimension varied with values used in the competing task (e.g., for shape task, stimuli red or blue; color task also used red/blue). [[Dimensions/Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|Bivalent stimuli]], filtering needed.
    - [[Dimensions/Response Set Overlap|Response Set Overlap]]: Disjoint (different keys for shape vs. color responses).

**Experiment 2: WM Load**
Participants switched between four tasks from two categories:
1.  **Object Tasks:** Color discrimination, Shape discrimination (overlapping stimuli, overlapping responses within this pair).
2.  **Spatial Tasks:** Up/Down location, Left/Right location (overlapping stimuli, overlapping responses within this pair).
    - No overlap in stimuli or responses *between* Object and Spatial task categories.
Compared performance in:
3.  **Single-task blocks.**
4.  **Mixed Between Categories (MBC):** Mix of one object task and one spatial task (e.g., Shape + Up/Down). Low ambiguity, 2 task sets.
5.  **Mixed Within Category (MWC):** Mix of two object tasks OR two spatial tasks (e.g., Shape + Color). High ambiguity, 2 task sets.
6.  **Mixed Within and Between Categories (MWBC):** Mix of three tasks (e.g., Shape + Color + Up/Down).
    -   **Ambiguous-MWBC (AMWBC):** Analyzing one of the object tasks (high ambiguity, 3 task sets).
    -   **Unambiguous-MWBC (UMWBC):** Analyzing the spatial task (low ambiguity, 3 task sets).

**Key Findings:**

**Experiment 1:**
-   **Mixing Cost:**
    -   Large and significant MC for Biv+F group.
    -   Minimal and non-significant MC for Uni+F and Uni without filtering groups.
    -   This supports the Task Ambiguity Hypothesis: MC primarily occurs with bivalent stimuli.
-   **Switch Cost:**
    -   Significant [[Effects/Switch Cost|Switch Costs]] were present in all groups.
    -   No significant difference in switch cost magnitude between the three groups. Stimulus bivalence did *not* modulate switch cost in this setup (with disjoint responses).
-   **CSI Effect:**
    -   Switch costs and overall RTs were reduced with longer CSI.
    -   The effect of bivalence on MC was more pronounced at short CSI.

**Experiment 2:**
-   **Mixing Cost & Ambiguity:**
    -   MWC (high ambiguity, 2 tasks) showed larger MC than MBC (low ambiguity, 2 tasks).
    -   AMWBC (high ambiguity, 3 tasks) showed MC.
    -   UMWBC (low ambiguity, 3 tasks) showed minimal or no MC, especially at long CSI.
-   **Mixing Cost & WM Load (Number of S-R Rules):**
    -   No significant difference in MC between MWC (2 ambiguous tasks) and AMWBC (2 ambiguous tasks + 1 unambiguous task). Adding a 3rd, unambiguous task did not increase MC for the ambiguous tasks.
    -   No significant difference in MC between MBC (2 unambiguous tasks) and UMWBC (1 unambiguous task + 2 other ambiguous tasks). Adding 2 other (ambiguous) tasks did not increase MC for the unambiguous task, compared to mixing it with only one other unambiguous task.
    -   This fails to support the WM Load Hypothesis (that simply increasing the number of S-R rules in WM generates MC).
-   **Switch Cost:** Switch costs were generally present but not systematically affected by the WM load or ambiguity manipulations in the same way MC was.

**Authors' Main Conclusions/Interpretations:**

-   The [[Effects/Mixing Cost|Mixing Cost]] is primarily driven by **task ambiguity** arising from [[Dimensions/Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|bivalent stimuli]] that activate competing task sets. It reflects the need to resolve this bottom-up interference.
-   The simple requirement to maintain more S-R rules in WM (WM load) does *not* seem to be the primary source of MC, at least when ambiguity is controlled.
-   MC and [[Effects/Switch Cost|Switch Cost]] are dissociable: stimulus bivalence strongly affects MC but not necessarily SC (especially with disjoint response sets).
-   Preparation (long [[Dimensions/CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]]) can reduce, but not always eliminate, the MC associated with bivalent stimuli, by allowing for more effective top-down control to overcome stimulus-driven interference.
-   The findings emphasize the role of **competition management** between task sets in task control.

**Relevance to Thesis:**

-   **Crucial for Mixing Cost:** This paper provides a detailed investigation into the [[Effects/Mixing Cost|Mixing Cost]], a key phenomenon in [[Task Switching]].
-   **Highlights Stimulus Bivalence:** Strongly supports the importance of the [[Dimensions/Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]] dimension in generating specific costs (MC).
-   **Dissociates Costs:** Empirically dissociates MC from [[Effects/Switch Cost|Switch Cost]] based on their sensitivity to stimulus bivalence.
-   **Informs WM Load:** Challenges a simple "number of active task sets in WM" explanation for MC, suggesting the *nature* of the stimuli (bivalent vs. univalent) is more critical.
-   **Interaction with Preparation:** Shows how [[Dimensions/CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]] interacts with stimulus bivalence in determining MC.
-   **Mapping:** The conditions (Uni, Uni+F, Biv+F in Exp1; MBC, MWC, AMWBC, UMWBC in Exp2) provide excellent, nuanced points for the [[Parametric Design Space]] map, particularly for [[Dimensions/Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]] and its interaction with the number of tasks held in memory (though the latter seems less impactful on MC here). The explicit use of cues and CSI makes it mappable to Super Experiment's timing parameters.
-   The finding that bivalence did not affect SC with disjoint response sets is an important detail when considering [[Dimensions/Response Set Overlap]].
