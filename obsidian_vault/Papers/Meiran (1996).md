**Core Goal:**  
To provide strong evidence for an active, time-consuming process of task-set reconfiguration that can occur prior to stimulus presentation (i.e., during preparation) in task switching, distinct from passive carry-over effects (like [[Task-Set Inertia]]). Introduces and validates the explicit task-cuing paradigm with variable [[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)]] for this purpose.

**Experiment Definition:**

- **Explicit Task-Cuing Paradigm:** Participants switched between two spatial judgment tasks (Up/Down vs. Left/Right) based on an explicit cue (arrow direction) presented before the target stimulus (a dot in one of four locations).
- [[N_Tasks|N_Tasks=1]] per trial, [[Switch Rate]] typically 50% (random cuing).
- [[Response Set Overlap]] = Identical (Left/Right keypresses for both tasks).
- [[Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|Stimulus Bivalence]] = Bivalent-Neutral (Target location affords judgments on both dimensions).
- [[Task Cue Type]] = Arbitrary (arrow direction maps to spatial judgment axis).

**Key Manipulations:**

1. **Cue-Stimulus Interval (CSI):** Systematically varied the time between the onset of the task cue (arrow) and the onset of the target stimulus (dot). Ranges varied across experiments (e.g., 100ms to 1100ms).
2. **Response-Cue Interval (RCI):** The time between the previous response and the current cue was also implicitly varied or controlled in some analyses to disentangle preparation from decay.
3. **Task Shift vs. Task Repeat:** Compared performance on trials where the cued task differed from the previous trial versus trials where it was the same.

**Key Findings:**

- **Robust Switch Costs:** Replicated the standard [[Switch Cost]] effect â€“ RTs were slower on task-switch trials than task-repeat trials, especially at short CSI.
- **CSI Reduces Switch Costs:** Increasing the CSI significantly reduced the magnitude of the switch cost. This reduction followed a negatively accelerating curve, with most benefit gained by ~600ms.
- **Large Residual Switch Cost:** Critically, switch costs were not eliminated even at the longest CSIs used (e.g., 1100ms). A substantial residual cost remained.
- **Preparation Affects Repeats Too:** RTs on repeat trials also decreased with increasing CSI, although typically less than switch trials, indicating general preparation effects beyond switch-specific reconfiguration.
- **RCI Effects Minimal/Dissociated:** The study argued (in later experiments and discussion, though Exp 1 confounds CSI/RCI) that the reduction in switch cost was primarily due to CSI (active preparation), not just increased RCI (passive decay), although decay might play a role.

**Author's Main Conclusions/Interpretations:**

- Task switching involves an active, time-consuming **advance reconfiguration** process that can be engaged during the CSI, reducing switch costs.
- This reconfiguration process cannot typically be fully completed before stimulus onset, resulting in a **residual switch cost**. This residual component might reflect stimulus-triggered completion of reconfiguration or potentially [[Task-Set Inertia]].
- The task-cuing paradigm successfully isolates preparatory reconfiguration effects from simple stimulus/response priming or passive decay effects (when RCI is controlled or accounted for).

**Relevance to Thesis:**

- **Methodological Importance:** Introduces the explicit **task-cuing paradigm with variable CSI** as a primary tool for studying preparation effects in task switching, contrasting with the alternating runs/RSI manipulation in [[Rogers & Monsell (1995)]].
- **Dimensional Relevance:** Directly informs the [[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)]] dimension and its impact on [[Switch Cost]]. Also relevant to [[N_Tasks]], [[Switch Rate]] (typically 50% random), [[Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]] (uses bivalent), [[Response Set Overlap]] (uses identical), and [[Task Cue Type]] (uses arbitrary).
- **Theoretical Importance:** Provides strong evidence for **active preparation (reconfiguration)** in task switching. Reinforces the concept of a **residual switch cost** that preparation time alone cannot eliminate, a key phenomenon your theoretical map needs to accommodate. Sets the stage for debates about the nature of this residual cost (incomplete endogenous reconfiguration vs. stimulus-driven completion vs. inertia).
