**Core Goal:**  
To investigate whether the compatibility between input (stimulus) and output (response) modalities influences performance in [[Task Switching]], specifically testing if [[Switch Cost]]s are smaller when modality pairings are compatible (Visual-Manual / Auditory-Vocal) compared to incompatible (Visual-Vocal / Auditory-Manual). This directly tests if the content-dependent central interference observed in dual-task studies extends to sequential task switching.

**Paradigm(s) Used:**

- [[Task Switching]] using an **explicit task-cuing paradigm** with random task sequencing ([[Switch Rate]]=50%).
- Tasks involved responding to the spatial location (Left/Right) of either a visual stimulus (diamond) or an auditory stimulus (tone).    
- [[N_Tasks|N_Tasks=1]] per trial.
- **Responses:** Either manual keypresses (left/right keys) or vocal responses ("links"/[left], "rechts"/[right]).

**Key Manipulations:**

1. **I-O Modality Compatibility:** Compared blocks with **Compatible** pairings (Auditory-Vocal AND Visual-Manual tasks switched between) versus blocks with **Incompatible** pairings (Auditory-Manual AND Visual-Vocal tasks switched between). This directly manipulates the pairing aspect of [[Response Set Overlap]].
2. **Task Shift vs. Task Repeat:** Compared performance on switch vs. repeat trials.
3. **Response-Stimulus Interval (RSI):** Varied between short (600ms) and long (1600ms) in Experiment 2 to examine the time course of the compatibility effect.

**Key Findings:**

- **Replicated Switch Costs:** Standard switch costs were observed in both RT and errors.
- **I-O Compatibility Affects Switch Costs:** Critically, switch costs were significantly smaller in the Compatible I-O modality mapping condition compared to the Incompatible condition (Experiment 1).
- **RSI Interaction (Experiment 2):** The I-O compatibility effect on switch costs was significant only with the short RSI (600ms) and was diminished (non-significant) with the long RSI (1600ms). Overall performance (RTs) was faster with compatible mappings regardless of RSI.
- **Single Task Performance:** No difference in baseline single-task performance was reported between compatible and incompatible mappings, suggesting the effect is specific to the switching context.

**Authors' Main Conclusions/Interpretations:**

- Task sets are **modality-specific**, not purely abstract. The linkage between input and output modalities is part of the task-set representation.
- Switching between tasks with incompatible I-O mappings increases [[Crosstalk]] between task sets, leading to larger switch costs. This suggests interference arises from activating conflicting modality pathways or bindings.
- The finding that the compatibility effect diminishes with long RSI suggests that the crosstalk or interference specific to incompatible mappings dissipates relatively quickly (within ~1 second), potentially reflecting the decay of interference or more effective task-set shielding given more time.
- Extends the findings of content-dependent interference (specifically modality pairing effects) from the [[Dual-Task Performance & PRP|dual-task]] literature (e.g., [[Hazeltine et al. (2006)]]) to the sequential [[Task Switching]] domain.

**Relevance to Thesis:**

- **Direct Empirical Evidence:** Provides direct evidence for the importance of **modality pairings** (a key aspect of [[Response Set Overlap]]) in modulating [[Switch Cost]]s, supporting the idea that central interference is content-dependent even in task switching.
- **Supports Content-Dependent Interference:** Aligns with the [[Hazeltine et al. (2006)]] findings from dual-task, suggesting content-dependent interference based on modality pairings is a general principle in multitasking, not just PRP.
- **Time Course Information:** Demonstrates that the interference related to incompatible pairings can be overcome with sufficient preparation time (long RSI), suggesting it primarily affects reconfiguration/preparation stages rather than being an inescapable structural interference.
- **Mapping:** This study represents a clear comparison between different types of "Disjoint-Modality" response set overlaps and should be coded carefully, potentially refining how we categorize or note different cross-modal pairings in your CSV. It highlights that "Disjoint-Modality" might not be a single category functionally.
