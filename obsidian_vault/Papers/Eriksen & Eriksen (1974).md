###### Core Goal:
To investigate the effect of flanking "noise" letters on the reaction time (RT) to identify a central target letter when no visual search is required (i.e., target always appears in the same, known location). The study specifically examined how the type of noise letters (response compatible or incompatible) and the spacing between letters in the display affect target identification.

###### Paradigm(s) Used & Key Manipulations:

**Paradigm:** [[Flanker Task]] (nonsearch version)
-   **Task:** Participants made a right or left lever press to a single target letter.
-   **Target Stimuli:** H and K (mapped to one response) OR S and C (mapped to the other response).
-   **Target Location:** Always directly above a fixation cross (0.5 deg visual angle).
-   **Noise Stimuli:** Three noise letters flanked the target on either side (e.g., NNN T NNN).
-   **Stimulus Presentation:** 1-second tachistoscopic exposure.

**Key Manipulations:**

1.  **Noise Type (Response Compatibility of Flankers):** (See Table 1 in paper)
    *   **1. Noise Same as Target:** Flankers were repetitions of the target letter (e.g., HHHHHHH if target H). (Congruent - Identity)
    *   **2. Noise Response Compatible:** Flankers were the other letter from the target's response set (e.g., KKKHKKK if target H). (Congruent - Response Set)
    *   **3. Noise Response Incompatible:** Flankers were letters from the opposite response set (e.g., SSSHSSS if target H). (Incongruent)
    *   **4. Noise Heterogeneous-Similar:** Flankers had visual features similar to the target's response set (e.g., N, W, Z for H/K; G, J, Q for S/C) but were not from the target sets. (Potentially a type of Neutral or less conflicting)
    *   **5. Noise Heterogeneous-Dissimilar:** Flankers had visual features similar to the *opposite* target's response set. (Potentially a type of Neutral or more conflicting)
2.  **Between-Letter Spacing:** The separation between adjacent letters in the display was varied:
    *   Closest: ~0.06 deg (edge-to-edge)
    *   Medium: 0.5 deg
    *   Widest: 1.0 deg
3.  **Control Conditions (Target Alone):**
    *   **Target Alone - Mixed:** Single target letter presented without flankers, randomly intermixed with noise-condition trials.
    *   **Target Alone - Blocked:** Single target letter presented in blocks where participants knew no noise elements would appear.

###### Key Findings:

1.  **Spacing Effect:** For all noise conditions, RT to the target decreased as the spacing between letters increased (Fig. 1). The largest differences between noise conditions were observed at the closest spacing.
2.  **Noise Compatibility Effect:**
    *   **Incompatible noise letters** (from the opposite response set) significantly impaired RT more than any other noise type.
    *   There was little difference in RT between "Noise Same as Target" and "Noise Response Compatible" conditions.
3.  **Heterogeneous Noise:**
    *   Produced intermediate RT impairment.
    *   At wider spacings (0.5 and 1.0 deg), "dissimilar" heterogeneous noise (features of the opposite set) led to longer RTs than "similar" heterogeneous noise (features of the target set).
4.  **Control Condition Difference:** RT to the target letter alone was significantly faster (approx. 30ms) in the **blocked** condition (where no noise was expected) compared to the **mixed** condition (where target-alone trials were interspersed with noise trials).
5.  **Error Rates:** Generally mirrored the RT findings. The highest error rates occurred with incompatible noise, especially at the closest spacing (Table 3).

###### Authors' Main Conclusions/Interpretations:

1.  **Limited Attentional Selectivity:** Participants cannot completely prevent the processing of noise letters occurring within approximately 1 degree of visual angle from the target, even when the target's location is known.
2.  **Minimal Processing Channel Capacity:** The visual system's minimal channel capacity for processing letters exceeds that required for a single letter. If other letters are present nearby, they will be processed simultaneously to some extent.
3.  **Locus of Interference is Response Competition:** The strong effect of the noise letters' response compatibility (rather than just physical similarity) suggests that the primary locus of the interference effect is at the **response selection stage**, not solely at early perceptual processing stages. Noise letters are processed to the point of activating their associated responses.
4.  **Inhibitory Process & Spatial Discrimination:** An inhibitory process is necessary to prevent responses to the processed noise letters and to allow selection of the response appropriate for the target's location. This selection process (based on spatial discrimination of the target) is:
    *   Slower and more difficult at closer letter spacings.
    *   More difficult when noise letters prime a conflicting response.
5.  **Preparatory Set:** The faster RTs in the "target alone - blocked" condition suggest that participants can abandon or reduce the preparatory inhibitory process when they know no noise letters will appear, speeding up their response to the target.

###### Relevance to Thesis:

*   **Foundational Flanker Task Study:** This is a seminal paper establishing key characteristics of the flanker effect in a non-search context.
*   **[[Dimensions/Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]]:** Clearly demonstrates the impact of response-congruent and response-incongruent flankers.
*   **Parameter Exploration:** Systematically varies flanker-target spacing, a key physical parameter influencing interference.
*   **Neutral Conditions:** While not using "XXXXX" type neutrals, the "Heterogeneous-Similar" and "Heterogeneous-Dissimilar" conditions provide early examples of attempting to create flankers that are not directly response-mapped, offering insights into different types of "less conflicting" stimuli.
*   **Response Competition:** Provides strong evidence for response competition as a core mechanism of flanker interference.
*   **Baseline Considerations:** The difference between mixed and blocked target-alone conditions is important for understanding how the expectation of conflict can modulate baseline performance.
*   **Mapping:**
    *   [[Dimensions/N_Tasks|N_Tasks]]: 1
    *   [[Dimensions/SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)|SOA]]: 0 (if flankers considered S2 attribute) / N/A
    *   [[Dimensions/CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]]: 0
    *   [[Dimensions/Switch Rate|Switch Rate]]: 0
