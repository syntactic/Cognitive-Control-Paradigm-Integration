###### Definition
**Task-Set Inertia (TSI)** is a theoretical account proposing that a significant portion of the [[Effects/Switch Cost|Switch Cost]] arises from **proactive interference** from the cognitive configuration (the "task-set") of the immediately preceding task.

The core idea is that the task-set from the previous trial (Trial N-1) does not simply vanish once the trial is complete. Instead, its activation persists or decays slowly, creating an "inertial" state that biases the system. When a new task is required on Trial N, this lingering activation of the old task-set must be overcome, which takes time and cognitive effort, resulting in a performance cost.

###### Key Proponent & Evidence
*   This theory was most prominently articulated by **[[Allport el al. (1994)|Allport et al. 1994]]**. Their experiments showed that switch costs were largely insensitive to manipulations of preparation time ([[Dimensions/RSI (Response Stimulus Interval)|RSI]]) and task difficulty.
*   This led them to conclude that switch costs do not primarily reflect a preparatory "reconfiguration" process that can be completed in advance. Instead, the cost is incurred *after* the stimulus appears, as the system resolves the conflict between the currently required task and the inertially active previous task-set.

###### Role in Explaining Key Phenomena
*   **Residual Switch Cost:** TSI provides a natural explanation for the [[Residual Switch Cost]]â€”the portion of the switch cost that remains even with very long preparation intervals. The theory posits that this is because the interference from the old task-set cannot be fully resolved until the new stimulus arrives and forces the conflict to be dealt with reactively.
*   **Asymmetrical Switch Costs:** TSI can also explain why it is sometimes harder to switch to a stronger, more dominant task. The idea is that more control is required to perform a weaker task, leading to a more strongly activated (and thus more inert) task-set. This highly active "weak" task-set then causes greater proactive interference when switching back to the "strong" task. ([[Yeung & Monsell (2003)]])

###### Contrast with Task-Set Reconfiguration
TSI is often framed as a "passive" or "bottom-up" interference account, contrasting directly with the "active" or "top-down" control account of **[[Theoretical Concepts/Task-Set Reconfiguration|Task-Set Reconfiguration]]**. While modern views see both processes as likely contributors, the TSI hypothesis emphasizes the persistence of the past, whereas the reconfiguration hypothesis emphasizes preparation for the future.
