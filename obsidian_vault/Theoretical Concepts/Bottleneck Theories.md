###### Definition
**Bottleneck Theories** are a class of models used to explain dual-task interference. They propose that human information processing is constrained by a structural limitation, or "bottleneck," which is a processing stage that can only handle one task at a time. When two tasks both require this stage simultaneously, one task must wait, forcing the processes to become serial at that point and causing a delay in the second task's response.

This concept is the dominant explanation for the [[Effects/PRP Effect|Psychological Refractory Period (PRP) effect]].

###### The Central Bottleneck Model
The most influential version of this theory, heavily supported by the work of [[Pashler (1994)]], posits a **central bottleneck**. This model generally divides task processing into three broad phases:

1.  **Perceptual Stage:** Early processing of stimulus features. This stage is assumed to operate in parallel for multiple tasks.
2.  **Central Stage:** A capacity-limited stage involving more complex cognitive operations. **This is the locus of the bottleneck.** It includes processes like:
    *   [[Response Selection Bottleneck (RSB)|Response selection]] (choosing the correct action).
    *   Memory retrieval (accessing information from LTM).
    *   Other complex transformations or judgments.
3.  **Motor Stage:** The execution of the selected response. This stage can also operate in parallel with the central processing of another task.

The core idea is that if Task 1 is occupying the central bottleneck, the central processing for Task 2 must wait. This waiting period is the "psychological refractory period."

###### Key Evidence & Methodology
Evidence for the central bottleneck comes from the "locus-of-slack" methodology in [[Dual-Task Performance & PRP|PRP]] paradigms:
*   Manipulating the difficulty of a **pre-bottleneck** stage in T2 (e.g., perceptual degradation) does not increase RT2 at short SOAs, because the extra time is "absorbed" by the slack period while T2 is waiting for the bottleneck to clear.
*   Manipulating the difficulty of a **bottleneck** stage in T1 (e.g., S-R mapping complexity) causes a commensurate delay in RT2 at short SOAs, as the bottleneck is occupied for longer.

###### Challenges and Alternative Views
While powerful, the strict bottleneck model is challenged by some findings:
*   **[[Effects/Backward Crosstalk Effect (BCE)|Backward Crosstalk Effect (BCE)]]:** The finding that features of T2 can influence RT1 suggests that some information about T2 is processed in parallel with T1's central stages, challenging a strictly serial bottleneck.
*   **Content-Dependent Interference:** Work by [[Hazeltine et al. (2006)]] and [[Stephan & Koch (2010)]] shows that interference depends on the specific pairing of stimulus and response modalities, suggesting the bottleneck is not a purely abstract, content-free mechanism.
*   **Capacity Sharing Models:** These models (e.g., from the EPIC architecture) propose an alternative where processing "resources" can be shared between tasks in a graded, parallel fashion, rather than being gated by an all-or-none bottleneck.

###### Relevance to Thesis
Bottleneck theory is the foundational conceptual framework for the entire [[Dual-Task Performance & PRP]] region of the [[Parametric Design Space]].
*   It provides a mechanistic explanation for the effects of manipulating [[Inter-task SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)|SOA]].
*   It highlights the importance of [[Dimensions/Task Difficulty|Task Difficulty]] as a diagnostic tool for identifying the locus of interference.
*   The debate between structural bottlenecks and graded capacity sharing represents a key theoretical axis that the parametric mapping in this thesis seeks to explore and contextualize.
