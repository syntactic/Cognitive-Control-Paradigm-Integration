###### Core Concept: The Flanker Task

The **Flanker Task**, developed by Eriksen and Eriksen, is a widely used experimental paradigm to investigate **selective attention** and **response competition**. It assesses the extent to which task-irrelevant stimuli (flankers) presented spatially near a target stimulus can interfere with or facilitate the processing of, and response to, that target.

The core finding is the **Flanker Effect**: reaction times (RTs) are typically slower and error rates higher when the flankers are incongruent with the target (i.e., associated with a different response) compared to when they are congruent (associated with the same response) or neutral.

###### Typical Paradigm Structure

1.  **Task Goal:** Participants are instructed to respond to a **central target stimulus** while ignoring surrounding flanker stimuli.
2.  **Stimuli:**
    *   **Target:** A single item (e.g., a letter, arrow, symbol) presented at a designated central location (often fixation).
    *   **Flankers:** One or more identical items presented on either side of the target.
3.  **Irrelevant Dimension:** The identity/features of the flanker stimuli.
4.  **Responses:** Typically involves a choice response based on the identity or category of the target (e.g., press left key for target 'H', right key for target 'S').

###### Key Conditions & How Congruency Arises:

*   **[[Dimensions/Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]]:**
    *   **Congruent Trials:** Flankers are identical to the target OR are different stimuli that map to the *same response* as the target.
        *   *Example (Identity):* Target H, Flankers HHHHHHH.
        *   *Example (ResponseSet):* Target H (maps to left key), Flankers KKKHKKK (K also maps to left key).
    *   **Incongruent Trials:** Flankers are stimuli that map to a *different response* than the target.
        *   *Example:* Target H (maps to left key), Flankers SSSHSSS (S maps to right key).
    *   **Neutral Trials:** Flankers are stimuli that are not associated with any of the task-relevant responses, or that prime competing responses equally.
        *   *Example:* Target H, Flankers +++++++ ('+' is not a response option).
        *   *Example:* Target >, Flankers <--> <--> > <--> <--> (double-headed arrows).
*   **[[Dimensions/Stimulus Response Mapping|Stimulus Response Mapping]]:** Typically `Arbitrary` for the target-to-response link itself (e.g., H -> left key). The congruency arises from the flankers.

###### Key Manipulations in Flanker Studies:

*   **Flanker-Target Spacing:** Distance between target and flankers (e.g., [[Eriksen & Eriksen (1974)|Eriksen & Eriksen 1974]]). Closer spacing generally leads to stronger interference.
*   **Flanker Load:** Number of flankers.
*   **Perceptual Similarity:** Similarity between target and flankers.
*   **Practice/Training.**

###### Theoretical Interpretations:

*   **Limited Attentional Focus ("Zoom Lens" or "Attentional Window"):** Attention cannot be focused so narrowly as to completely exclude processing of adjacent flankers if they fall within a certain spatial window.
*   **Response Competition:** Flankers are processed to a level where they activate their associated responses. If these conflict with the target's response, competition arises, delaying selection. This is often considered the primary locus of the effect.
*   **Perceptual Grouping:** Flankers might be perceptually grouped with the target, influencing its processing.

###### Relevance to Cognitive Control:

*   Measures the efficiency of **selective attention** in filtering out distractors.
*   Probes mechanisms of **response selection** and **inhibition** of prepotent but incorrect responses.
*   Used to study **conflict monitoring and adaptation**.

###### Key Parameters for Design Space Mapping:

*   [[Dimensions/N_Tasks|N_Tasks]]: 1.
*   [[Dimensions/Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency|Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]]: Defines congruent/incongruent/neutral conditions.
*   Flanker-Target Spacing (often mapped to [[Task Difficulty]] or an SE coherence parameter for the target/distractor interaction).
*   [[Dimensions/SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)|SOA]]: Typically 0 (or N/A) as target and flankers are presented simultaneously.
*   [[Dimensions/CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)|CSI]]: Typically 0.
*   [[Dimensions/Switch Rate|Switch Rate]]: Typically 0%.
