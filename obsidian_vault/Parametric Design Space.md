The core idea of this thesis is to conceptualize standard cognitive control paradigms not as discrete categories, but as regions within a multi-dimensional space defined by underlying experimental parameters.

**Key Goals:**

1. Identify the relevant [[Derived Dimensions vs. Low-Level Parameters|derived dimensions]] based on literature.
2. Map existing empirical studies onto this space using their parameter settings.
3. Analyze the structure of this space (potentially using [[PCA]]) based on parameters definable within the [[Super Experiment Framework]].
4. Identify [[Key Transitions Between Paradigms]].
5. Identify gaps (unexplored regions) and limitations (dimensions outside the framework).

**Dimensions Tentatively Identified:**

- [[N_Tasks]]
- [[SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony)]]
- [[CSI (Cue-Stimulus Interval)]]
- [[Switch Cost]]
- [[Stimulus Bivalence & Congruency]]
- [[Response Set Overlap]]
- [[Task Cue Type]]
- (Initially considered, likely excluded) Cue Validity
