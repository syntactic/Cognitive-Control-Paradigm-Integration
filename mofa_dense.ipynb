    "# Analysis of the Cognitive Control Design Space with MOFA+\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook trains and analyzes a Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA+) model on the cognitive control literature dataset. The goal is to extend the initial PCA by using a more flexible, probabilistic framework capable of handling heterogeneous data types and inferring robust latent factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is as follows:\n",
    "1.  **Load and Preprocess Data**: Use the `mofa_utils.py` script to transform the wide-format CSV into the long format required by `mofapy2`.\n",
    "2.  **Train the MOFA+ Model**: Configure and run the `mofapy2` training pipeline. This step is computationally intensive and the model will be saved to disk to avoid re-running.\n",
    "3.  **Analyze the Trained Model**: Use the `mofax` library to load the saved model and analyze its components:\n",
    "    *   **Variance Explained**: Determine the importance of each factor.\n",
    "    *   **Latent Space Visualization**: Plot the factors to visualize the structure of the experimental space, analogous to a PCA plot.\n",
    "    *   **Factor Interpretation**: Examine the feature weights to understand the conceptual meaning of each latent factor.\n",
    "4.  **Advanced Analysis**: Discuss the path towards advanced analyses like interpolation, highlighting the differences from the PCA workflow."
